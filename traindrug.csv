"I had terrible, terrible side effects. went into seizure, whole body paralysis, nearly died, They should ban this drug !",1
"I'm naturally depressed/anxious, but this medicine has made it so much worse. Panic attacks, headaches, suicidal thoughts. Awful experience.",1
"My experience on this medicine was Awful, to say the least. I gained 40 lbs and became extremely depressed, and started having anxiety.I am now struggling with body image due to this. It had a huge effect on my joints as well. I am now weak, always sick, have stomach issues, and am always tired. I never had any of these symptoms before starting it.",1
"As a heathcare professional having given Mucomyst to patients over more than 30 year career, I've yet to observe any benefit from the aerosolization of this med. I don't want to minimize the previous comments. Used during a bronchoscopy in liquid wash, it will dissolve thick mucus quickly and effectively but the benefit of aerosolization has not been demonstrated or established in any controlled study. Also, after more than 24 hours of use, the lung tissue will begin this is a very caustic substance to lung. Too often it's order for a specific problem area of the lung. As the laws of nature take effect in that gas follows the path of least resistance, Mucomyst is delivered to all areas of lung with minimal effect to the problem.",1
Started out fine but after 3 weeks I started to experience sharp pains in my chest and abdomen. Still need to see doctor.,1
"I've been on three different kinds of birth control. I used this one twice in the past and had horrible experiences. This pill gave me awful depression from the first day of use (both instances). I could only stay on it three weeks the first try, and one night the second. If you are someone with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder or similar, I would suggest strongly against taking this oral contraceptive. It gave me suicidal thoughts that followed into my dreams. Traumatizing experience. If I could rate it lower, I would.",1
"Pure torture  I am 2w2d preg and have developed a yeast infection , was told monostat 2 was safe to use but OMG IT IS WORSE THAN THE YEAST INFECTION !! Not 2 minutes after I inserted the cream I had the most intense itching and burning I have ever had in my life ! And I have been to the bathroom with water and a wash cloth 3 times since wiping until it is about raw down there and everytime a little more trickles out the torture begins again !!! Never will I buy this again !!! I will be calling the doctor for some other course of treatment !",1
"I purchased the zzzquil and it did not work not 1 bit , I would not recommended medication to anyone...",1
"I was started on Celexa about 2 months ago, my moods have increased thoughts of suicide, feeling worthless, sweats , nervousness. Everyone's different I guess.",1
"This medicine does not work.  Obviously, the physicians are provided incentives to prescribe this non-effective medicine.",1
"This is the worst drug I've ever taken. It gave me horrible tremors, anxiety guilt complex.",1
"I was diagnosed with FM 3 years ago. Tried gabapentin, Cymbalta, muscle relaxers and opiates. Doc finally had me gave me lyrica (after I had to try everything else first) ams at first, it worked. I did feel  but that slowly went away. After approx. 2 weeks of 22mg a day, I had horrible side effects..feeling depressed, like people were talking about me or didnt like me, had no memory or wasn't able to concentrate but what finally got me to stop was I had thoughts of driving my car off of a hill that i drive down daily. I may suffer from pain so intensely that I cry all the time, can't leave my home at times or feel blue because of it, but I had never thought of taking my own life. I stopped immediately despite my docs orders.",1
"Was on Lo Loestrin FE before which was great, but this has been horrible! Insurance was not covering Lo anymore so Dr. suggested this. 3 months and I've had 12 lbs of weight gain, and feel bloated ALL the time. Acne for the first month and then it cleared after that, but weight gain continued. Shortness of breath, indigestion late at night (even not having anything to eat within the last 4 hours). Did not notice a decrease in PMS symptoms either like I did on Lo Loestrin. Getting off this pill for a while to regulate and going to bite the bullet and pay for Lo Loestrin .",1
Does not work for my fibromyalgia.,1
Tried to take months earlier but stopped due to nausea and diarrhea. Gave it another try today....bad idea. Very sick within 1 hour of taking. Horrific headache followed by vomitting everything in my stomach.,1
"I started this shot in order to stop my already heavy flow, and it did the complete opposite! Every time that I take the shot, I am period free for a week, and then after that, 3 months of constant bleeding. It was the worst idea ever. Thank goodness that I did not go with the arm implant, I bet that I would have been bleeding for 3 years straight, no breaks!",1
did not really help with back pain.,1
"My insurance refused to pay for my oseni they told my Dr to try januvia. During the first 2 days I developed a constant cough along with upper stomach pain and diarrhea I stopped med and symptoms ceased, started back on meds yesterday and severe stomach pain returned along with diarrhea. Stopping this med for good - it's not good for me, the side affects are  too painful.",1
"The general side effects of dehydration and urination aside, those were not my problem.  Fatigue was the issue.  I was on 30mg to start and noticed after six weeks a decrease in mental acuity -- missing things I might not otherwise, more forgetful.  My dose was increased to 300mg and all I wanted to do was sleep.  Went back down to 30mg, but the exhaustion continues.  Time to try something else.",1
I have been on this pill for 2 months and have put on 8 pounds which is very uncommon for me. I also have zero sex drive. I am getting off this pill immediately. I'm going back to a regular monthly period pill.,1
"My doc told me I had an upper respiratory infection and prescribed the Z-pack and Benzonatate for the coughing. My cough was severe and already had lasted a week with it. My abs were super sore from coughing so much. The first time I took this, it seemed to work. I barely coughed the next few hours. When I took it again though it didn't do anything. In fact it made me cough more than if I hadn't taken it. Kept taking it before I went to work and it would cause me to have coughing fits and now my ribs hurt.",1
"Terrible product, would not stay on and did nothing for the pain.  Received more relief from aspirin. Will never purchase again.",1
I gave myself an injection of the medicine in my doctor's exam room under the direction of the drug rep following instruction on administering the drug and diet instruction.  No one checked my blood sugar level nor my medical history.  I assumed the injection was safe because my doctor allowed the rep to give it to me.  The next morning I awoke to a panicked husband because I was thrashing about in the bed and he could not waken me. He had given me a peppermint orally and called 911.  I could see his face but could not speak to respond to him.  My feet and legs were cramping but I could not communicate this to him nor my daughter.  The EMTs gave me glucose and I recovered quickly.  My husband and daughter fearfully watched me for weeks.,1
"I started taking norethindrone (mini pill) and within two days I felt emotionally awkward.  This emotional roller coaster did not come on gently either; it came rolling in and took over my mind, my thoughts, my reactions.  I became angry easily, and without a moments notice my emotions changed like the wind.  There was sadness, crying, depression, emptiness, anger and frustration.  These emotional spells were only 20 mins apart at the most! I was yelling at my children constantly until I realized it was the mini pill that was my problem.  This is a horrible drug  for me and women should know the truth.  After I stopped the pill, my emotional state became stable again.   Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1
"Was given 30mg cymbalta for pain in hip as well as depression due to chronic pain. It's been 2months, after about 3weeks of many side affects, diarrhea, nausea, headache, the  pharmacy told me to stick with it, they will pass. They have except I've gained about 2lbs. The depression is better, the pain isn't any better, in fact seems to be getting worse. I don't think the cymbalta is making the pain worse, I think my hip is just getting worse. But not happy about the weight gain since I was fighting my weight before I took it. And being heavier can't be good for a bad hip.",1
"I had my nexplanon inserted in Jan of this year. 2012. It's now June and luckily I get it out 1 week from today and am getting my tubes tied and endometrial ablation(so I don't have period) due to the side effects of this. Like others stated it is effective in not getting you pregnant BUT I too am like a lot of others who have a period constantly with maybe 1-2 days off after about 2 straight weeks then back on. It's inconsistent and I'm always on. That's not the only HORRIBLE part... SECOND, it's super heavy. Like gushing within 30 min of a changing tampon. I have to wear super tampons (which hurt) and a pad and I still end up changing underwear all day! My husband is just as frustrated as I am. I'm moody. Migraines. Backaches. Horrible!",1
"Was forced to switch from 4 to 2 Norco every 24 hrs. to Hysingla ER 30. I've gotten massive headaches every day in the past 2 wks. since starting it, far less pain relief, itching and swollen abdomen. My Dr. insists I need to stick with it.",1
"I was given this in an IV (along with Benadryl) in the ER when I had a horrible migraine. The nurse said it would make me tired when she gave it to me at 4 pm. Well I was tired for about 3 min. then the began. Like the other poster, I started to feel extremely anxious. I kept tossing and turning in the bed because I felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I had to wait for 2 IV bags to finish before they would let me leave. When I got home I was exhausted but at the same time could not sit still to save my life. I had that wanting to crawl out of my skin feeling all night as I paced the house exhausted. I was finally able to fall asleep at 2 am. The next day I was really shaky and still a little bit anxious. ",1
Had to discontinue after 3 days due to severe depression symptoms that started with taking the medication.,1
I had the shot on October 2th 2012 and I can honestly say that I would never recommend this shot to anyone. I have bled every single day since I received it and it is now December 3th. Talk about about low sex drive when you're constantly bleeding 24/2. Not fun. Not to mention that it has made me feel weak every second of the day. I don't know if it's from bleeding so much or what. It's also caused stage 1 acne on my face. I've never had problems with any kind of acne until receiving this shot. I've gained about 2 pounds since October too. Needless to say I will never be on this birth control again once it wears off. It has made me feel absolutely awful about myself.,1
On Lipitor I developed Polyneuropathy in my left foot. Burning and electrical charge sensations. Stopped Lipitor and problem went. Took several weeks before it left my body.Everyone on Statins should be taking Co Enzyme Q3 or Ubiquinol to help prevent muscle pains. I prefer quality of life to one of pain. I am an active healthy 83 yr old with high cholesterol. ,1
"With in the first 20 minutes of taking this medication,  I started dizzy, disoriented, my mouth had gotten numb . With in 42 minutes I went into full anaphylactic shock and was taken to the er. So unfortunately this isn't for me.  I just had my 3rd colonoscopy and  actually now have severe Crohn's.  Getting ready to start remicaide. I'm nervous but hopefully this will rid the pain and suffering I've been going through.",1
My father was given this after a PSA climb following chemo treatment.  Chemo shrank swollen lymph nodes and PSA drops to around 2 but climbed 1 point after Chemo. Taking this medication has made no difference as his PSA. The doctor is switching him to Firmagon as he says it shows aggressive PSA reduction in studies.,1
"With only 4 doses of 200 mg in 3 days instead of 3 a day, my symptoms got progressively worse. Blurred vision, dizziness, rash, leg pain and swelling, heat sensations in legs, muscle pain, back pain, swelling and pain in stomach, and extreme fatigue. Stopped taking and reported adverse reaction to pharmacy and will tell doctor. Very glad I did not take full dose. Use with caution if you are sensitive to meds.",1
"I first started 18 mg once a day, no noticeable change. Then increased to 40 mg once a day, at first I seemed to just be calm and zombie like with no change to my ADD. Then, 2-3 weeks later insomnia, paranoia, depression, rage, panic attacks, and severe anxiety consumed me so badly I couldn't leave my house. I feared for my safety and the safety of others so I stopped the drug immediately! I was having thoughts of violence toward others and myself, I am a 28 year old woman and was on no other medications and no other conditions besides ADD. I'd rather just deal with my ADD than all those scary feelings I've never had before.",1
"Dr. switched me from 20mg generic Lexapro to 300mg of generic Wellbutrin XL HCL (bupropion) because I felt a lack of energy on the Lexapro.  I didn't notice any change of energy level with the Wellbutrin, but had many side effects: significant weight gain (30 lbs in 8 months) despite it being &quot;weight neutral&quot;constant headaches, joint pain, muscle ache, stomach pain, blurry vision, constipation and sleep disturbances.  Switched from CVS pharmacy to Publix pharmacy and pills were different (small white round at CVS, large white oblong at Publix).  Switching to new generic only made side effects worse. Went back to the generic Lexapro and after 3 weeks, all symptoms ceased and weight is dropping back off.  Wellbutrin is not for me.",1
"I suffer from insomnia for nearly 8 months now and have tried melatonin, OTC sleep aids, ambien, trazadone, etc nothing worked. Asked my doctor if I could try belsomra and was given a sample 3 mg dose for 3 days, it kept me awake all last night and tonight as well. So tired of not being able to sleep!!!",1
"I wasted almost  on two spray bottles of Afrin because of the horrible safety cap. It is not a child-resistant cap. It is a Fort Knox style security system. In the end, in desperation to breath without driving back to the drugstore, I cut the top off one of the bottles with a skill saw. Once I got to the Afrin, it worked good enough -- but that took fifteen minutes of frustration. I will never, ever buy this product again because of the horrible packaging. The cap is more than poorly designed -- it's an insult to the consumer. Now that I can breathe again, I'm on my way back to Walgreen's for a refund and to buy another brand of nasal decongestant.",1
"I am 21 yrs old.  Took this medicine for 8 days.  Kept getting weaker and weaker.  Then, barely breathing.  Spent 4 days in hosp.",1
This has been the worst pill ever. I have been bleeding for 13 days and it has not stopped yet. I had to go to my obgyn for evaluation and told to stop taking them right away. I start my new pill tri sprintec next I have taking that for seven years and never had a problem with. The only reason y it got switched is because the pharmacy told me it was the generic.,1
"Latuda didn't even come close to touching my bipolar depression. I kept waiting and waiting for it to work, but nothing happened. I ended up having a horrible depressive episode that almost got me hospitalized. Plus, I had to eat a 320 calorie snack with it, which was always difficult to figure out. On top of that, it would knock me out every night, which would be considered nice...if it didn't knock me out at 2-8pm.",1
"Horrible reaction to Zoloft , ended up in the ER after 2 doses(12.2 mg) . That morning I awoke at 2 am sweating , achy, nauseous , heart racing, could barely walk legs hurt so bad. It's been 3 1/2 weeks since I stopped it and I still have pain in hips and muscle aches / burning sensation in legs and constant chest pain from palpitations.",1
"Only on day 4 and can't take the constant nausea and off feelings anymore. Vivid dreams, sweating, but the worst is definitely the gastro issues. Bloating, acid reflux, severe nausea. Tried taking it with food, tried taking anti-nausea pills and so many other things, but it wouldn't work.",1
"I'm on day 2, so I have taken 4 pills and I feel absolutely horrible nausea.  I have aches all over like the flu and pains in my stomach, sharp ones.  I can barely keep my head up.  I am stopping them and going back to the doctor tomorrow.  I have never felt so bad, also very explosive diarrhea. I'm thinking of going to the hospital.  I feel as if I have been poisoned.",1
"This is the first ever experience I've had with extreme side effects from a medication. This has been the worst experience of my life. I've been taking it at 9:30 every night. I wake up in the middle of the night at 2:00 am every night with extreme nausea, something that I didn't experience before taking this. When I wake up in the morning I instantly feel dizzy and nauseous. This continues on throughout the day. Half way through the day the anxiety starts to take over. I start to experience shortness of breath, shaking, and light headedness. Once the panic attack ends, I get a headache more towards 2:00pm-2:00pm. This has been happening every day since I started this pill, and I'm just told to keep pushing through.",1
I decided to take one of these bc of travelers constipation&quot;  I was at my hotel and was hoping this would be a simple solution to the slight constipation I get when travelling - what a mistake! I woke up middle of night and didn't know what was wrong with me - I felt like I could pass out or wondered if I was having a heart attack! never had a bowel movement either  will never take ever again,1
This pill is the devil!! Don't do it!!!! I have seriously considered contacting the FDA to have it removed from the shelves! Made me feel completely out of control of my body and sick to my stomach to the point I had to lay down and hope I wasn't having a heart attack! Don't buy this crap!!,1
"I ended up in the ER three days after starting it feeling like I couldn't sit still and I was going crazy. I was shaking, feeling short of breath and feeling suicidal. ",1
"Allergic reaction to Anaprox, this is poison I do not understand how the FDA approved this medication that almost kill me. I do not recommend it because of the dangerous side effects and should be taken out of the market. IT IS POISON AND I ONLY TOOK ONE 229 MG IN THE GENERIC FORM ( NAPROXEN )",1
"I have been on this for about 2 months and I've recently been getting extremely tired all day long (even if I take it way earlier the day before). The drowsiness is so extreme that I cant even watch a show. I'm literally struggling to stay awake all day cause I feel like I just wanna sleep my life away. My depression has been through the roof as well! And to top it off, the weight I have gained since I have been on it, has been insane. I constantly wanna eat all the time! I have gained at least 20-30 pounds in the past month or two! I am definitely gonna tell my doctor I want off of it ASAP! I cant take it anymore ",1
"Gave one star to Zoloft for its effort, but really it deserves zero stars from my experience. I was on Remeron, then Cipralex (Lexapro for American users) for almost a year and when it stopped working I decided to go with Zoloft after reading good reviews. Zoloft slowly turned me into the worst version of myself. Constant anger, irritation, nausea, no appetite, no motivation, and man the heart burn was unreal. And the list goes on and on. I took it for a week at 22mg and 3 weeks at 20mg to give it a shot but I had to stop because I was just falling apart. I am currently on Effexor, its been almost a week and it is slowly putting me back together from the Zoloft disaster.",1
Patanase caused headaches that increased daily until I had a 12-hour migraine. I quit taking it and the headaches stopped. ,1
"This medicine was given as an alternative to Xifaxan because my insurance won't cover Xifaxan. My Doctor says there is a 20% chance it will work. I am on Day 2 of 3 and have seen no results as of yet with no relief of my symptoms. Side effects the first couple of days were brutal, I think my body has begun to adjust now.",1
"I was prescribed mivaso from my dermatologist for rosacea, I suffer from flushing / red face - especially my cheeks. I applied it at night to see how it worked and I was very impressed!! All the redness had disappeared. I continued to use it every day for about a week (only a little bit in the morning before I did my make up) I thought it was a miracle cream, every now and then I would have hot cheeks and redness but I put that down to my rosacea and being flared up by something like coffee.......But then I started having rebound flushing, my face felt like it was on fire, my cheeks were red/purple it was hard to work or function in life. I had never experienced burning and flushing like that before. Stay away from this product!!!",1
"My son was prescribed 22 mg venlafaxine by his physician for anxiety and depression. He had many of the side effects for 18 months without realizing it was from the drug. Excessive burping, yawning, insomnia, mood swings, and tremors. He stopped taking them and after 8 days had a manic episode from the withdrawals. He was hospitalized in ICU for 4 days. It almost killed him. Do not take an anti-psychotic or anti-depressant drug without a diagnosis from a psychiatrist. This type of drug must be monitored weekly by a professional. After follow up care with a psychiatrist said he has probably never been depressed but had situational anxiety disorder from the pressure of college. He now has PTSS from the experience getting off the drug.",1
This is a terrible pill and I wouldn't recommend anybody to start this med unless you are ready for the bad side effects of coming off of this med when it doesn't work . This med cause me to lose about 3 years of memory lose and almost my marriage.,1
"I was on this for 3 months and only got up to a 30 mg dose. My lips peeled, my face peeled, I got depressed and finally it made me want to die. I am a super positive person, and I don't think I could have felt so bad about myself. And on top of it my skin did not change because I wasn't able to complete the treatment. Stay away.",1
I have had the paragrad iud for 1 year and my periods are horrible I pour blood and cramp so bad I can't move. I have a period twice a month both lasting 2 days. Last month my strings came out but the dr wouldn't remove it due to having to cut me open to get it out. Now a month later horrid pain where I can barely move and its now embedded in my uterus. I would never recommend this to anyone. Worse decision I ever made,1
My husband is in the hospital right now and they put a brand new knee in and he was doing pretty good until they gave him that drug.  It was horrible for him.  He was like a different  person.  He did not know where he was or even who we were.  He was screaming for someone to call the police.  I cannot imagine anyone taking that.  Norco 3 is the strongest thing he can take and that is just one pill when needed.  He took one dose of that and that is all....horrible experience for him.,1
"The absolute WORST medicine I've ever taken. I haven't seen a single good review on this, and now I'm wishing I would have read these sooner. Every single one of them is true, there's a reason this is rated 2/3. I wouldn't have given it a 1 if it gave me a choice for 0. I was seeing double for weeks, and thinking that it may have just been that my eye doctor didn't shape my contact right, sure enough, it was this awful birth control. I had 3 periods break though bleeding 3 times and I was only on my second week of the second month. I gained 12 lbs in that short amount of time &amp; after researching it, I stopped taking it immediately, 2 days ago &amp; my eye sight went back to normal almost immediately. I've already lost 2 lbs in two days.",1
Made it worse. Had a little bit of yeast but after taking the product i gained more yeast and a smell.,1
Just starting to use my prescribed gabapentin for RLS.... I'll let you know how it goes! It'll be amazing if my stomach will even tolerate it!,1
"1st day fine. 2nd day it made me SO sick. Severe stomach cramps and I mean severe. Nausea, dizziness, headache, racing heart, backache, weakness  and fatigue. I haven't used it for 2 days and most symptoms have cleared but the stomach cramps and fatigue are still very painful. MD said to go to emergency for stomach pain but its an hour + drive so I opted to try to sleep it off. Since its still ongoing I'll be seeing my MD tomorrow. I will never take this again!",1
"As soon as a started my first pack of Sprintec, I immediately was having severe depression and mood swings. I am a healthy, fun loving, young girl who has little problems in life. This medication made me feel horrible about myself, and gave me a really negative outlook on daily activities. My boyfriend commented on my mood changes and obvious depression and lack of enthusiasm for activities I use to enjoy.",1
"After trying several pills that did not agree wth me, I ended up on minastrin for the last 2 years.  I had minimal side effects and I never got my period or any of the symptoms, loved this pill!!  I was given mibela from pharmacy earlier this year, and I absolutely hate it!!! Most definitely not the same as minastrin, no way this the generic form.  After being on it for 2 months, thinking the side effects would level out, its worse than ever!  I eat fairly well and exercise at least 3-2 times a week. I get ankle swelling, gained 12 lbs, very bad headaches at least 3/4 times a week, cramps, extreme mood swings, depression to the point where I didn't want to leave my house, and got a very heavy period every other week lasting 3-4 days",1
Unfortunately was unable to affectively try this product. I experienced severe burning in my eyes following application. I contacted Allergen (manufacturer of Restassus) immediately with my side effects and they offered a complete refund. Thrilled that I was able to re-coup my money as this was a VERY expensive prescription ($1400/cash... 3 month supply). I am impressed with their support and willingness to refund.,1
Awful experience!! Couldn't get the cap off so I spent 30 minutes trying to get it off.  After 30 mins and a bloody cut up thumb I finally just grabbed my old bottle of nostrilla (which I would have much rather bought but couldn't find any at the store.  For anyone reading this nostrilla is a 3/3 for me!!) Punctured a whole in the afrin bottle and squeezed the stuff into the nostrilla bottle... so nostrilla you the real MVP!!,1
"I DO NOT recommend this birth control to anyone. Become informed prior to having a foreign object inserted into your body. I had horrible panic attacks, constant feeling of nausea, digestive issues, heavy periods, and painful sex. My PMS symptoms were 20 days out of a month. I had the paragard for over 4 years before having it removed 2 weeks ago. Getting a piece of plastic with copper wrapped around it shoved into my cervix was a bad idea. I had my first period last week since removal and it was a much easier process. We are given these &quot;safe and effective&quot; forms of birth control so most doctors can push other forms of medications to treat symptoms from the side effects. The pharmaceutical companies run this country. Beware.",1
"I'm only on day 2 and I had to call out of work because I've felt nauseous all day. Yesterday I was nauseous, but today is 3x worse. I have chills, loose stools, woke up with a weird taste in my mouth last night, and I'm sick to my stomach. I've barely gotten out of bed all day, and I have no idea how I'm supposed to complete 3 days of this medication. I feel like I've been poisoned and it's slowly killing me.",1
"Used it for six weeks. Cluster headaches, Not able to sleep. Foggy all day from lack of sleep. Mind raced 300 miles per hour. bm several times a day. muscle cramps in feet dosage 2 mg to start 2 days 3 mg 2 days 12 mg on day 2 at night.this went on for 2 weeks doctor saying it would get better. it didn't. finely stopped and went back to depakote. I can live with the small tremors. back to being able to sleep no headache",1
"Took this drug for high blood pressure. Started out on hydrochlorothiazide but had a lot of side effects from it. Then switched over, took it one night and only got 4 hours of sleep. Next day I took my blood pressure and it was insanely high. Highest blood pressure reading I've had. I went to urgent care and they suggested I go to the ER. At the ER they did a lot of tests and couldn't find anything. 48 hours after taking amlodipine blood pressure still hasn't gone down. If I could give this drug a negative reading I would. Stay clear of amlodipine. Highly don't recommend.",1
It did not work for me at all. I felt no difference and it did not bring my anxiety down.,1
"A doctor gave me Ultram with Trazadone for a sprained wrist and insomnia/anxiety. I took them both at bedtime and by morning I was throwing up with one of the worst headaches of my life, on my birthday. I threw up all day.",1
Took brand Mircette for 2 months. Great for skin &amp; body adjusted quickly to brand only. Had no immediate side effects but the manufacturer never made enough. Was forced to generic. Estrogen placebos did nothing to help menstrual migraine/estrogen withdrawls dibiltating headaches. It was actually worse on this pill. Many trips to ER. On brand I didn't have the daily headaches. Sex was ridiculously painful on both  3rd month on brand was unbearably dry in my vagina. Took kariva &amp; had the most dibiltating migraine/daily headaches ever. All dr's denied the correlation. Had break though bleeding/spotting tampon amounts for 3 months &amp; then anemic. Demanded to be removed off this! Get rid of your gyno if she doesn't believe you.,1
"Diarrhea only lasted a day. I was pleasantly surprised how fast Viibryd began working. I felt so much better not even five days into taking it, which NEVER happens with me! I thought I had finally found a medication that worked after six years. About two months into taking it I had gained about ten pounds, my vision had gotten worse, my sex drive had gone from being very very high to literally NOTHING (took three months after I stopped taking for it to return), and my depression and anxiety were back in full swing.  It wasn't normal depression where everything is just boring and you're lethargic and what not, it was the angry, scary, unpredictable depression I've only experienced from bad reactions to other medication in the past.",1
It was such a horrible experience I will never use this again and would never recommend this to any girl it was like knifes were stabbing you and a painful ich,1
I sprayed this on my mild sunburn and it intensified the burn by 2.  I  immediately had to shower with cool water. Instead of having my mild sunburn I ended up with a really intense sunburn.  It was horrible experience!  Parents should be really careful using this product on children.,1
After using Diovan for only a few days I developed shortness of breath and my blood pressure skyrocketed. I was also very lethargic. Within 2 days of stopping going back to my old blood pressure medication my pressure dropped significantly. This drug did NOT work for me for what it was prescribed for.,1
"I started taking Abilify about 4 weeks ago. I am bi-polar. Of course the highs are great and the lows, well you know. My doctor thought that this would cause me to level out the highs and lows. Not such a bad idea but I think (no way of knowing for sure) this medication has caused me to go down gradually. Seems like it eliminated the high altogether and caused me to drift into a moderate low. Unlike before taking this med, I am able to still function somewhat better than full blown depression. Right now I feel pretty poorly with anxiety and depression. I have  thought about stopping this medication and after reading some of these experiences, I've decided to stop this medication (2 mg) today and see what happens. I still take Lamotrigine.",1
"After six months of using it, I lost my libido. After one year, I took the mirena out and in one day my libido returned. Three months later I detected a lump and it was breast cancer. I am sure the small amount of estrogen created the harmful cancer cells.",1
Only been on it for a week and I'm feeling awful.  I know I need to give it time but the panic attacks are worse.  I'm having to take Ativan so I can calm down. This morning I woke up and had that all over feeling with sweats rapid heartbeat I know blood pressure was elevated.  I'm feeling so defeated.   Head still hurts.  Having all the attacks again that put me in ER 4 times.  I love reading others comments and hearing it gets worse before better.   Thanks for the feedback.,1
I was forced to take this medication by my prescription coverage. It has by far been the worse experience of my life! It doesn't help with going and leaves me in horrific pain and so bloated I can't breathe. If you have IBS-C run far away for this drug! I am impatiently waiting to get the over ride on my old medication.,1
"I don't know why, but Propofol does not seem to provide the advertised effects for me.  I  just got it today for an RFA nerve block on both knees.  I was a little loopy but essentially Wide-awake.  Despite my telling the medical staff I was wide-awake several times,  they continued with the procedure.  They did give me more Propafol, but no dice. I try to be low-key and  composed during medical treatments, but I screamed and cried through the whole thing.  I actually felt the ablation happening, it was horrible.  I felt like I was pretty much ignored by all of the medical staff besides the nurse.  I guess they thought I wouldn't remember it, but of course I do.",1
"I'm shocked to see not a single negative review listed. The first day taking Wellbutrin after drinks with a friend (not advisable) we had a bad fight, my anger was uncontrollable. That next day I had a fight with my roommate, I was absorbed in rage, completely unaware of others' feelings. That week I was stuck in my head, angry, charged, paranoid and isolated. A week later I had terrible fight with my roommate resulting in a BAD physical altercation, cops were called, next day she moved out. Next day I was extremely depressed and indifferent. I stopped taking it. Maybe I didn't give it time. Don't want to discourage others but if you have irritability/anger issues be very aware and cautious.",1
"Botox did not work for me. A geneticist confirmed that I have DYTI dystonia, which is one of the hereditary forms. The symptoms I'd experienced were on the left side of my neck. Botox DID reduce those movements. Unfortunately, my head steadily began to pull to the right and my torso twisted as well. I also experienced &quot;floppy-head,&quot; which feels like someone is pushing the back of your head so that your chin nearly touches your chest. Not fun. Botox is also a toxic substance and the full effects are not yet known. All of this may be due to the genetic nature of my condition so it may work better for those with the secondary type.",1
"I was prescribed Luvox for anxiety and panic attacks.  Initially Luvox just made me tired.  After about 2 weeks it started making me feel depressive.  Continued taking it for about 2 months, the depressive symptoms only got worse.  I had to discontinue medication because it caused depression for me.  Did not help for anxiety or panic at all.  When tapering off I suffered severe nausea and headaches.  Didn't work and has bad side effects.",1
"I took this drug for a month, my condition got worse. I ended up in the hospital it got so bad. It's been over 4 months since I stopped taking this drug and I still feel the effects. Please ask questions before taking this drug. I should have looked into it more.  Find out what percentage of people actually get better, the last time I checked it was 33% get 22% better, what about the other 22%. Thankfully I have good doctors that figured out how to help me.",1
"2 days, 2 pills a night. It will clean you out good, but at a cost. Burning pain and an hour of cramping later, you'd wish you never took it. It's not worth it. If you have another option do it. So far the worst pain I've ever felt.",1
"I am BEYOND angry at how terrible my skin broke out while using this medication. It was a mystery to myself and family when my face began to break out terribly, to the point where I was prescribed oral acne medication and the painful cysts still didn't go away. This medication almost ruined my skin, I am so thankful I stopped when I did and read these reviews! It's honestly infuriating that this was the cause! I stopped taking this pill about a week ago and my skin has already cleared up substantially. Do not recommend!!!!",1
I had a major breakdown and was hospitalized. My psychiatrist put me on effexor. I took it before bed and by 2 am I was running fever and felt like I had the flu. It was by far the worst medicine I have ever tried. EVER. I woul never take this again. I felt horrible all day the next day and wouldn't get out of bed. It was a nightmare.,1
"I complained to a friend of insomnia, mainly stress related. She offered a seroquel on the promise that it would relax me and put me in la la land. I will never again take medicine that is not prescribed for me! For the first time ever... I heard voices starting at 2 am. I heard two men arguing on the other side of my closed bedroom door, loud enough to wake me but I couldn't make out what they were saying. I was too afraid to look because I knew no one was there. Then around 4:30 am I heard a baby crying non stop this lasted until 2:00 am. I sat up for hours listening to what if feels like to be going insane! Never again!",1
It made me tired and didn't relieve my anxiety.,1
"Due to my increasing anxiety and panic attacks I was prescribed Lexapro 3mg. During the first few weeks I became very sensitive and would nearly cry over simple things like a customer saying ; please don't put this item in the bag with that item. I had very high blood pressure, bad headaches, rapid heart beat, I would feel weak and my body would start shaking (especially my hands). One time I even thought I was having a minor heart attack. I decided to ween off Lexapro and change medication.",1
Caused vomiting and gave me worst headache.,1
"I am 22 and in good health.  I don't take any medicines except aspirin.  I do get bladder infections every once in a while.  I was given this medicine and had a terrible reaction.  My whole body would start shaking like I was freezing or standing outside in the snow with no clothes on for 3 minutes.  I would do everything to try and get warm and keep my teeth from chattering but nothing helped.  I couldn't walk right, it was like I had palsy.  The only thing that gave me relief was taking two aspirin.  In about 20 minutes the shaking would stop. I went back to the doctor and he couldn't figure what the problem was.....well I'm allergic to this medicine.",1
"READ THIS PLEASE!! I was taking falmina for only one month, on my last week of almost being done with the first pack, I started getting panic attacks, depression, and anxiety. I would cry for anything and started getting so much nausea, I couldn't even eat at all only drink water !! It's the most horrible symptoms I have ever experienced  with birth control. I couldn't even be around my kids. I read this site and stories and didn't think it will happen to me, because I tried different birth control and this never happened !!",1
"I was taking Ortho-Tri cycles Lo for many years. I don't recall having any problems. Up until last year, for some reason my prescription changed to TriNessa because it was the &quot;generic&quot; version of Ortho. I went back to the doctors to get a refill last month and they put me on another generic brand this time of TriNessa. Within the first week of taking it I was getting bad migraines. The second and third week I was feeling nauseous all day with also bad stomach pain. I noticed I was feeling depressed and unmotivated. One thing that scared me was my mood swings. I wasn't aware of it at all until my boyfriend said I went from being happy to irritable within minutes. After not even a full month of taking this pill, I will be switching.",1
The patches kept coming off after 2 to 3 days. The backing is way to hard and not   enough to peel off 2nd half without touching 1st half of patch causing that part not to adhere to skin. Bayer should really consider 3M's adhesive manufacturing and backing that peels with ease and stays on until removed and in water.,1
No relief of voices. I rarely have visual hallucinations anyway. Very bad menstrual irregularity and some dry mouth. Had to quit taking it.,1
I paid a doctor $22 online thru Contrave website and $30 for the medicine.  I've been doing exactly as prescribed with zero results.  I can't even tell I'm taking anything.  I have been on it for 2 months.,1
"I used this for one  month and I was devastated when the medicine left me shedding much much more hair than I had before. People told me to stick it out because that's what it's supposed to do. I'm terrified to lose more hair since my hair is already so thin, so I stopped using it. No one warned me it could get this bad.",1
"I was given this medicine for the 2nd time yesterday. I have had it before no issues but this time not the case. I took my first dose at night and this morning my feet and hands are burning and itchy. I keep rubbing the bottom of my feet under my desk to see if it will stop. I am dizzy, headache and my pain is actually worse. I get UTIs all the time and usually use other meds but the CVS Minute clinic gives this one for some reason. I will NOT be taking anymore and will be going back to get a different medicine.",1
"The side-effects far outweigh the benefits for me.  It took about 2 weeks for the good effects to kick in - and when they did, I felt like a huge boulder had been lifted off of my chest, I could cope with things much better.  However, the nausea is still present, even though it's been two months since I started.  What's frightening is the blurred vision.   My vision started getting blurry not long after I started Pristiq, and it has become worse.  It has gotten to the point where the words I'm typing are now blurry and the laptop is less than two feet away from my face.  Am weaning myself off of this and have an appointment with my doctor next week.  Too bad... I was hopeful about this one. ",1
"I started taking this bc to help with my cramps and heavy period, very bad choice because I have literally been bleeding for 2 months! Most of the time it was spotting, some days it was so heavy and the cramps... they are the worst. I've become extremely depressed, I cry like crazy, I can never sleep past 3am and I have become so mean to people.  I wouldn't recommend this bc to my worst enemy,  it's terrible",1
I originally began taking this pill to lessen the pain of my period cramps and make them lighter. It did make them lighter but my cramps did not improve. I also wanted to protect against pregnancy which it did. I broke out a lot less. My boobs were sore and tender ALL THE TIME. The huge issue I had with this pill was the mood swings and weight gain. I was very irritable and constantly snapped at my mom and my boyfriend which caused arguments in our relationship. I was tired all the time. I cried over everything and was just very depressed. I did notice I would eat more which caused me to gain a bit of weight. I would not recommend this pill to anyone. It's not worth the emotional roller coaster it puts you on.,1
"I've been taking tramadol for the past few years and forgot I even had restless legs syndrome. I'm going off tramadol so I can try Cymbalta. Once down to 30mg of tramadol my restless legs syndrome reappeared so my doctor prescribed Clonazepam, for 2 nights in a row I've tried this, up to 2mg and it only intensifies my RLS, which is more like RLB (body). Even the next day my body is so incredibly restless, especially my upper arms/shoulders. Unfortunately I'm having to stop this and the Cymbalta to go back to Tramadol as I can't take another sleepless/restless night.",1
"OMG!  This is the first time I have ever seen anyone else besides myself have an issue like this with Reglan.  The first time I got it was while waiting to have surgery and the longer I sat there, the more panic stricken I became til I was just sure if I stayed I was going to die in surgery so I pulled the IV, got dressed and went home.  When it wore off I felt crazy so called nurse at ay surgery and she said it happens frequently and we should try again using plain saline, not even ringers solution.  I was fine the second time around.  I also get it from Compazine, phenergan and ativan.  They call this reaction Akathesia.  ER gave me Cogentin and a couple of xanax and it was gone in 12 minutes.  AWful, awful feeling!",1
"What experience??? It would be nice If I could get the top to open!!! Even my husband is puzzled by this new top!  You're not only keeping kids from using the bottle of nasal spray your keeping ME a woman in my mid sixties from using your product! I have arthritis but can usually be creative and get to a product somehow! In your quest to be SAFE you have lost a customer!!! I will use a competitor from now on. I have used your various nasal sprays on and off  for years and you have now gone beyond the absurd in your quest for safety, or whatever it is you are doing it for. Maybe you should consider version or go back to the original...only then will you get my loyalty as a customer back! Leave well enough alone!",1
"Was going in for a heart Cath, put on repatha because I can't take statins. Dose 1, some diarrhea, mild back pain and feeling like a kidney stone was trying to move. Dose 2, same feeling as dose 1, seemed a bit worse, wrist, knees and ankles slightly swollen.  Dose 3,  Two hours after injection,  felt like my teeth were 3 inches tall , lost the use of my legs for 2 hours, joints ache and low back pain,  2 on pain scale, 3 days later, upper right quadrant pain, muscle spasms,  hurt to walk, knees and feet felt like they were on fire. Nipples are painful, short of breath and can't get enough sleep, tired all the time.  Been to ER, advised to discontinue repatha. Been 42 days, still having severe back pain and very short of breath,",1
"So I got the implanon inserted 2 years ago in the last 2 years I have gained about 20 kgs , lost my sex drive , my emotions have been up and down like a yoyo just cry then want to punch something then have no idea what I was even sad/angry about . I would get my period for 2 weeks then another 3 weeks of spotting then it finishes then 1 week later I start pmsing again . But I didn't get pregnant ! I have just had it taken out 1 year early as I can't deal with the side effects anymore . I guess there are different contraceptions that work for different people but I must say this one didn't go well for me .",1
"The side effects of this cream were bad. Very painful sinus, swelling of throat and inside mouth, continuous cough on chest, headache (don't usually suffer headaches, dizziness). May be good for some people but not me. (I am 24).",1
"Within 4 hours of taking the first dose of this medication my coxcyx began to itch, which was odd.  About six hours after taking the first dose I had terrible, intense, painful itching that was uncontrollable throughout my groin area including vaginal and anal itching. The more I scratched the more I itched. I tried Ice, and benedryl which helped a bit so I didn't go to the hospital.  In the morning the doctor changed the antibiotic and I  was  also given something to  successfully treat for the worst yeast infection I have ever had. Several years later I had the same experience (I forgot ) and now list cefdinir as a drug allergy. I am not allergic to any of Cefdinir's relatives, or penicillin.",1
"I have only been on it 4 days - I take two pills a day.  I have not noticed anything other than being extremely tired and my back hurts.  I'll keep it up for a week or so, but if nothing changes will go off of it.  I'm so disappointed.",1
Well this little guy did his job he kept me from getting pregnant so that's one pro....for the others I don't any other pros. had my IUD taken out it but it broke. I have a arm lodged into my side which I am having surgery in a couple days to have it removed hopefully!  My periods were worse they lasted longer and not to mention the spotty period thru out the term I used this product!  It hurt going in it hurt coming out!  If I had to do over I wouldn't have gotten this or at least this type.,1
"I switched from another pill to this one because of side effects of the other pill. This pill regulated my moods, and increased my chest size and sex drive. However, I gained 12lbs in less than 2 months and was unable to lose it despite diet and exercise. It also gave me dangerously high blood pressure which went back down when I switched off of it. So if you are worried about weight gain and blood pressure this isn't the pill for you. Periods were also heavier than on the previous pill I was on.",1
"My face currently looks like a pizza. Not only do I have the worst acne I have ever had in my ENTIRE life (I am 22 years old, mind you - I have been on birth control since I was 12) my last period was 3 days and I spot regularly. I absolutely HATE this birth control. Generic for Loestrin my butt, absolutely not. They need to remove this from the market today. Lomedia - the best birth control - had my period down to about 2 days, maybe. I am switching over to Blisovi as of today. This birth control is not worth it.",1
Took my first injection on Wednesday 29th June 2012 early hours Thursday woke to terrible stomache pains wind belching and diarrhoea. Feeling dreadful in myself ate a salad Wednesday evening hardly anything since. A full feeling that just doesn't go away overall I've experienced a really bad few days and still not right it's Monday 4th July today I hope these side effects go soon as I'm having trouble taking medication for other ailments. ,1
I have been on Pristiq for muscle condition and fibromyalgia pain for over a month. No improvement in pain. Wish I had some of these marvelous results.,1
"Still wide awake on most nights at 22mg,  Took 20 mg one night slept good, but drowsy the following day throughout the evening!",1
"Didn't work at all, found it only made me feel worse.",1
As soon as I started on this drug I experienced an inability to ejaculate.  I tried to come off it once and it landed me in the hospital.  That was with a period of weaning me off Venlafaxine 22 mg ER.   I would not advise any active male to take this drug.,1
In one week I went from a heart rate of 98 to 22. Some days I ran in the 40's. My blood pressure became very low. I was taken off it after one week trial. It had no effect whatsoever on my atrial fibrillation.,1
"I had the implant since 2009 I got it removed and replaced when my 3 years came. On 2012 when my 3 years was up again I haf it replaced , but this time they replaced it with the nexplanon I bled for almost 2 weeks than stop for a month and it would be off and on constantly! Than In may I started my period and it is now the begging of July and I am still bleeding and it's been heavy and will not stop! I hate this birth control so much I can't wait to get this thing out!!",1
"I got the depo shot on the way out the door of the hospital after having my daughter. I wasn't good at taking a pill everyday so I thought this sounded good. Like others, I have been bleeding for 8 weeks straight. I had horrible mood swings, depression, and increased anxiety. No desire for sex and really my ability to have sex has been limited. I went to the obgyn for a pap smear and she said my cervix is friable and very thin and so it everything in my vagina so sex is very painful. I believe the hormones from the depo did this. I also have a lot of nausea and am sure I have gained weight. I have lower back pain and abdominal cramping. Causes bone loss which runs in family.",1
"Taken off Escitalopram 3mg which I was on for years and put onto Paroxetine 20mg for generalised anxiety and sleep disorder. Experienced terrible side effects- dizziness and almost fainting, headache, tingling extremeties, nausea, weight loss. I was feeling like a whole different person in general. But nothing was worse than the withdrawal effects. I basically felt like a walking dead person- all of the above plus severe flu-like symptoms- I literally couldn't leave bed for days. Took a couple of weeks to feel good again but had to start taking escitalopram again to get there.",1
"My doctor prescribed me Ponstel recently.  I suffer from endometriosis, and am in pain 3 weeks a month.  I took the first pill, fell asleep shortly afterwards.  When I woke up, I had horrible pains shooting through my stomach.  I was told to stop taking it, and got prescribed good old Vicodin.  I realize I'm in a small percentage of people who have had problems with this medicine, but since the other reviews have been good, I wanted to let people know that it does have side effects.",1
Caused severe allergic reaction when I had never had a reaction to any medication before. Had to be hospitalized. Doctor said he has been seeing more and more allergic reactions to Cipro.,1
"I had botox May 22, 2012 for migraines. Woke up the next day with severe neck pain. Its Sept 3, 2012 and my neck is still hurting. I can't look down, turn my neck, read, clean my own house. I'm spending most of the day in bed. My life is ruined due to botox for migraines. I've had so many problems and I never was told about this side effect. It is not worth the risk. I wish I had known about this. The pain is horrible!",1
"First time I used it on a single small white spot of my vitiligo. After an hour or two every part of my body started itching, had tingling sensations, skin got super red and hives appeared everywhere. Never again. Can't wait for the side effects to go away.",1
"I have only been on the medication for two weeks.  I was taking one pill in the morning and one in the evening.  I have to stop it, the nausea is TOO MUCH.  I also suffered from headaches, not bad but just enough to be troublesome.  So basically because of the nausea and headaches, I could not get through my work day.  Really sad about it.",1
"I almost never experience major side effects from any medications, and I have been off and on many antidepressants over the past 14 years. I was taking zoloft for a couple months, which was helping with my depressive symptoms, but I though it might've been giving me sexual side effects, but I wasn't sure so my doctor suggested trying trintellix. He said it has a lower incidence of sexual side effects.  Well, not only did trintellix give me horrible sexual dysfunction and even lower libido, every time I took this drug for two weeks, I literally felt like I was coming down with the FLU about 12 minutes later.  Headaches, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, feverish.  I really do think this stuff is poisonous, and needs to be pulled from the market.",1
Amrix made me sleepy. And then for a week after 1 pill I was so irritable is was like psycho PMS and I hated everyone and everything. That stuff is toxic and I'll never take another one! Avoid it! Oh and my neck still hurt. Useless.,1
Neuropathy and about 22 different side effects dealing with neuropathy that lasted over 2 years.  Stay away from this drug,1
My feelings of depression were actually amplified by this.,1
"I got this april 2012 and have experienced extreme depression, rapid weight gain, irregular bleeding for weeks, acne, increased breast size, decreased sex drive and horrible mood swings. This has been the worst time of my life.",1
I started on 12mg of Belsomra. The doctor said if this did not work he would put me on 20.  I had trouble falling asleep and drifted in and out of sleep all night and felt like crap the next day. Constantly felt like the need for a daytime nap. He up the dosage to 20 mg and nothing changed. I could not get a good night's sleep. Never felt good day or night. We left for Florida after I was on the drug for a month plus and I could not keep the car on the road as I kept falling asleep.  My wife became angry and made me stop taking the pills.  What to do with them at that point??? I turned them in at the police station under the drug disposal plan rather than throw them in the garbage. They informed me they were a narcotic.,1
"I was recommended the nexplanon after I was told I could no longer take the pill due to my history of blood clots. At first I thought, &quot;yay I can just have it in my arm and forget about it!&quot; Man was I wrong! My insertion was August 2012. I weighed 184 lbs after having my daughter and I weight 222 now. I had constant mood swings, feelings of depression, brain fog, constant fatigue, super bad acne, and I spotted ALL the time. I don't recommend this to anyone. I never had acne like this before now. I have always struggled with my weight but I was so fatigued all the time I had no motivation to get up and exercise. I ate pretty healthy but it didn't matter. Just getting up and going to work was a struggle. I just had it removed today!",1
"I have had pretty severe breakouts and my dermatologist first prescribed epiduo to me, i take it, and for the first week, the only change is my skin getting incredibly dry (which is odd because my skin is not normally dry or oily) but the dryness was tolerable. The next week things went very bad, i had terrible breakouts on my forehead, and on my cheeks, chin, and nose, i was incredibly dry and my face turned completely orange, after that week i stopped using epiduo and my skin continued to stay red and acne-y and i had to call in sick to work because it was intolerable and felt like my face was on fire. DO NOT RECOMMEND",1
"From the reviews, I think this pill gave me a more rough experience than others. The day after I switched pills I had a dull headache and slight nausea. It faded after a few hours and I didn't think about it again. Later that night, I experienced the nausea again and it quickly progressed to violent vomiting. Every time I took the pill, regardless of the fact that I'd taken it on a full stomach, I would get a debilitating headache and nausea. It felt like I had the flu. Today was the first day I haven't taken it (4 days in) and I feel great and was able to carry on my day as usual. I changed to this BC because my insurance covered it, but I'd rather pay for my old stuff that doesn't make me sick.",1
"I was switched to this pill when Gildess Fe got recalled. I have gained weight and have noticed irritability and tiredness. I have repeatedly asked my pharmacy if they have gildess back to no avail. I think I need to try something else regardless, this pill is not working for me.",1
I have fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis.  I took one Lyrica pill and it caused me to hallucinate.  I was afraid to take another one so I had my pharmacist dispose of the medicine for me. ,1
"If I could rate this medication 0 I would. I was in the hospital due to a severe migraine while pregnant.  They gave me reglan IV and i swear to god it produced the worst dysphoria imaginable. I felt like I wanted to rip my IV out and leave the hospital. I called my fiance up histerically crying begging him to leave work and come pick me up. It gave me a panic attack so severe I still get anxious just thinking about the experience.  Reglan should be banned in my opinion.  Ive never experienced anything like that in my life. Oh and almost forgot, it made me twitch for about 3 days after having it.",1
"DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING THIS! I took it back it 2014 for a few months and took my dose about 4 hrs late. Let me tell you, I thought I was going to have to be put in a psych ward. I laid down to go to sleep and had brain zaps (loud bang and pops in your ears that aren't really there). I saw birds dying at my face, I felt a demon trying to smother me into my bed and saw children burning in a house! All because my dose was late. My Dr told me to wean off immediately. I was terrified to lay down at night because this continued to happen while I was trying to get off it. NEVER BEEN SO THANKFUL IN MY LIFE TO BE RID OF SOMETHING! After my experience and reading about others' experiences, I can't believe it's still available to ruin lives!",1
"Side effect's kicked in were worse than my condition.  Already take zofran for nausea &amp; vomiting.  This drug actually started me vomiting again.  If you have depression &amp; anxiety issues &amp; pain issues in joint's, etc...  can make it worse &amp; over ride medication.  Thank goodness my doctor gave me samples because extremely expensive even with insurance.  Do not take if you are allergic or don't take/eat pork ingredient's...I'm not - but is warning I wasn't told about.",1
"Why does ProAir keep making bigger and BIGGER inhalers!?! Over the years they have gotten huge and hard to carry around. I often carry my inhaler in my pocket or in my purse (which is small), but I just picked up the new ProAir and it's way too big. I can't even put it in my pocket. Plus I find the fact that you can't take it apart and wash it really disgusting. Directions say to wipe it off, but this thing is going in my mouth...I prefer soap and water which you can't do with this inhaler. I'm going back to the old stuff.",1
"This pill is horrible. I've tried my fair share of different birth control pills, this being my 4th, and it is by far one of the worst. Since I've started it, it makes me hungry at all times- I NEVER feel full, ever! I can eat and eat and eat and not feel a thing. The increase in appetite and the want to binge has made me gain about 12 pounds since starting this pill about 2 months ago. The main reason I'm on birth control is to lighten my very heavy periods, which it does, but the side effect of increased appetite which causes weight gain makes it not worth it. Will definitely be switching to a different pill asap.",1
"I was given a sample by by gynecologist in June, and I stuck with that until it freaked me out of giving me a 2 week heavy period. I stopped and the bleeding stopped. Then I talked to my doctor and she told me to stick with it so I got back on it again. I stuck with it and I still kept having the same symptoms but I listened to my doctor. I got a new doctor (my old one isn't with the clinic I go to anymore) and she prescribed me a higher dosage. I started taking that and got my period a few days into the pack. It was great at first, I was able to wear regular flow tampons without leaking. That was until the fifth or sixth day in when it got really heavy. I have now been on my period for 4 weeks. I talked to my doctor. I don't recommend this",1
"Since day one I've been having a bad experience. It keeps making paranoid because my period was late and because of the patch (hopefully) it made it end super early. I have the chills, cramps, headache, nausea and vomiting. I feel like I'm pregnant and I shouldn't be feeling like I am. I want to be intimate with my man but I can't because as directed I can't do sexually active for a week when first using it. I have to wait until Tuesday when my Gyn is open to let them know what's going on. I hate feeling nauseous and throwing up.",1
"About 2 weeks ago my Dr put me on Lipitor for my cholesterol. I've been having all kinds of side effects from it but I didn't realize it until today, I've been beside myself with itching, I keep getting these stinging sensations, like I'm being attacked by a colony of fire ants, I'm prone to insomnia (very severe) and it made it so much worse, despite the fact that I have been feeling I was coming down with something serious (constantly exhausted). I've even developed blisters in my NOSE! and I have the red spots it's insane. No joke I seriously have about 80% of the listed side effects even the unreported and rare. I hope no one ever has to deal with this craziness.",1
"Every month since I have started taking Sprintec, I've gotten a yeast infection exactly one week before my period. Even with antifungal medicine, the yeast infections continue. I had never had a yeast infection before I started taking this medication. Also, I made no change in my diet and gained at least 20 pounds and moved up four cup sizes. Sprintec did help with minor acne.",1
I have been on amitiza on and off for 2 years if not more. With a combination of IBS and opaids from pain management. I realize today that I am so much better without amitiza.  As of today i am stopping this. Amitiza causes my BM to be sooooo hard that I might only go once or twice a week if i am lycky. And get just a little balls.  Maybe once a month diarrhea. The worst part is when I do go a larger amount it is so hard I can break the toilet. More od a baseball. Sorry TMI ...At least when I am not taking it I still go once or twice a week but it's not so hard and little balls. I do notice Alli  works for me my insurance won't pay for it but its only $20. But my copay for amitiza is 30. Now I am stuck with a 3 month supply,1
"Started taking this for depression when I was 12 (12 years ago). After about a week, I had a massive panic attack that lasted for 2 days straight and I've had a panic disorder ever since. Medication destroyed my life.",1
"I had a bacterial infection and feeling ill, and the doctor prescribed Bactrim. I didn't think it was helping as my illness took a turn for the worst. I had fever, chills, muscle weakness and pain, stomach pain, and I couldn't get out of bed. I'd start to feel better after a few hours and thought it was finally working. Nope. I took my next dose of Bactrim and all the symptoms came back full strength and I was severely ill again. I finally linked it to Bactrim and stopped taking it. My symptoms cleared up over the course of a few days. I learned my grandmother and mother have a severe sulfa allergy, and I found out the hard way I do too. Words just don't describe how sick I was on this medication.",1
"I complained to a friend of insomnia, mainly stress related. She offered a seroquel on the promise that it would relax me and put me in la la land. I will never again take medicine that is not prescribed for me! For the first time ever... I heard voices starting at 2 am. I heard two men arguing on the other side of my closed bedroom door, loud enough to wake me but I couldn't make out what they were saying. I was too afraid to look because I knew no one was there. Then around 4:30 am I heard a baby crying non stop this lasted until 2:00 am. I sat up for hours listening to what if feels like to be going insane! Never again!",1
Doesn't work at all for me. I'm still in pain wish I can find something to ease my sore and paining lower back an legs.,1
"I'm 42 years old and have lived a pretty normal life except for my occasional heightened anxiety. Recently, my anxiety and panic attacks had escalated out of control. I was feeling out of touch with reality and having multiple panic attacks a day. Unfortunately for me, after 2 doses the Effexor caused mild hallucinations; light pixelating and things moving in fast motion. It was adding to my anxiety so I went off immediately and the hallucinations went away.",1
"Zolpidem worked well at the 2mg dose for about 3 or 4 nights.  Then I noticed my lips were dry, mildly cracked, and tender.  Gradually I noticed that the tip of my tongue felt as though it had been burnt. I ignored that as I drink hot coffee.  On the 4th day I used a Listerine-like mouthwash; the result was an immediate and severe reaction:  the inside of my mouth became bright red and swollen. My face broke out in scattered red spots or streaks. Once I had spat out the mouthwash and the pain had gone down, I noticed that my eyes, or the tissue around my eyes, also felt dry and sore.  Two days later, the reaction is gradually clearing.",1
"While effective for bipolar depression,this drug gave me constant daily migraines, that does not respond to any medication, that was agonizing pain. Couldn't tolerate this any more.",1
"I do not recommend this birth control. I am a healthy 20 year old with no previous medical history. A month into taking this new birth control (I changed doctors and she changed me from ortho try cyclen because she doesn't like it) so I decided to give it a try. Within first 2 weeks face started breaking out bad, mood changes, appetite change (constantly hungry),feet started swelling and then chest heaviness and palpations along with shortness of breath. Needless to say I stopped taking it and I now I feel fine. Do your research before starting a new pill.",1
"I have used Monistat 1 about a year ago and a few more times before, worked great,  relief within 24 hours.  My current experience is a complete 180. The burning and itching is unbearable.  I can't imagine what the makers have done differently,  they need to go back to the original formula, which worked fine.  I wish I used the 3 day or just went to the Dr. It's bedtime,  but the pain is keeping me awake. I will never purchase again!!!!",1
"My 2 year old daughter was given this medication for sinusitis. 30 minutes after her first dose, she started trembling. We didn't know what was going on. Then suddenly she started vomiting. We decided it was a reaction to Cefdinir. Very scary. Threw the rest of it away.",1
I was also given this through I.V. and started freaking out as well. I got really cold and my muscles contracted involuntarily and my teeth started chattering and grinding. My vision got dark around the edges and I could only see out of pinhole shaped . (Like looking through the wrong end of a pair of binoculars. I woke up several hours later wrapped in heatead blankets.,1
Express scripts switched this one in place of my Microgestin FE 1.2/30. This has been the worst experience ever. I missed taking a pill by 2 hours and I had already began breakthrough bleeding and severe cramping. To where I had to leave the office at work and just lean over and hold my stomach. The absolute worst part is the depression. I'm crying about everything and getting upset with my boyfriend over nothing. I've only been taking this for two weeks and it's been a hell storm. I do not recommend this brand.,1
"I have been on this birth control for a month this week and I thought I liked it up until these last few days. I&rsquo;ve noticed a lot of mood swings, increased anxiety, and this little part of me wants to say depression but I'm not sure if my increased anxiety is making it worse for me. Enough for me to bring it up to my primary care doctor. For the past few days I&rsquo;ve been having anxiety about having depression like as if I&rsquo;m scared to become depressed and I don&rsquo;t like it AT ALL. I originally started this birth control because I&rsquo;ve had irregular periods since I had my baby a year and a half ago but unfortunately  it's a huge no for me.",1
I've only started taking this medication today I'm meant to take 4 tablets a day. After my 3rd tablet I feel extremely nauseated with severe stomach cramps and so fatigued. I don't think I can last another 2 days on this medication. I'm seriously thinking whether to go in work or not tomorrow because I feel so bad.,1
Pain in my neck and head. Also have a lot of mucus and my muscles are very stiff.,1
I would never buy this product again I thought I might of pick up some thing defective or out dated it burn so bad I had to run and shower then in the night I put on can not stand one minute of it they should discontinue this product it is so much torture for anyone to bare I do not recommend this product at all I used the off brand and didn't have a problem but this monistat 2 is all bad (NO DO NO TRY IT OR WASTE YOUR MONEY BAND THIS PRODUCT FROM STORE NO ONE SHOULD GO THOUGH THE BURNING OR PAIN),1
"Cambia is Diclofenac Potassium. This company added flavor consisting of mint and anis (liquorish flavor). Also they added aspartame which is not a good thing. They charge hundreds of dollars for only nine powders. The actual drug of Diclofenac Potassium is cheap and you get a 30 day supply. I just crushed the pill into a powder and took with water just like the Cambia...worked just as fast and tasted better, because it had NO taste. Don't be fooled by the makers of Cambia. It is just another Epi Pen scandal story.",1
Thought the nausea would pass but it didn't. I feel like a complete zombie that is constantly on the verge of throwing up. I'd rather be depressed than stay on this medication.,1
Movantic does nothing more than put you in complete withdrawal. Eat a high fiber diet and you want be put thru HELL !!! The pain docs will not tell you this when they prescribe it . And thats what the pharmaceutical co. don't want you to know !!!!!!!!!!. No more of my money....bahaha,1
"I am on day 4 of using the Nuvaring and I am ready to take it out. It has caused me severe anxiety, mood swings, uncontrollable crying, severe panic attacks. It is awful! 3/3 DO NOT RECOMMEND",1
"I was on Loestrin 24 Fe for about 2 months. I'm active and have a very busy lifestyle but this pill just made me feel like a lunatic. I felt like I was on the verge of crying all the time, really depressed, really anxious and really tired. Serious mood swings, headaches, breast tenderness, acne- it also made me starving- like Permanent PMS. I didn't want to work out and I didn't want to socialize. I gained maybe 2lbs but that's probably from not working out and eating way more. It did make my heavy crampy periods light and short and my breasts noticeably bigger. Birth Control is different for everyone, I'm very in tune with my cycle when I'm ovulating and very sensitive to a shift in my hormones. This one was just not right for me.",1
"The only good thing about this medication is that I'm not pregnant. I've been taking aubra for about 3 months now and the issues I was told would go away after the first pack are still truckin'. My period is nothing more than a day or two of spotting which is pretty cool but the constant moodiness and terrible nausea are not worth it. My relationship and health is suffering from this. I'm always feeling sick to my stomach so I've only been eating healthier, simpler foods but they still make me feel awful. I've been gaining weight and breaking out and freaking out at my boyfriend and having random bouts of depression that is usually controlled by other medication I take. Also, the IBS-like symptoms I have constantly throughout the month!!",1
"A very dangerous medication. I was prescribed it for headaches. Many side effects were problems I was already having. I told my doctor about I, and so did my wife on many occasions. The doctor said keep taking it, the good out ways the bad. And if I don't take it. They will not try a new.medication,or see me again. So I tried it for 21 days. Hallucination, didn't no if I was awake or dreaming. Many bad things. Then out of know where. I shot myself under the chin. Some how I survived. After coming out of coma and many surgeries. I did more study on the medicine. I'm 42. In the testing of this drug. 31% of all males between 41 and 49 committed suicide on it. That's one in three males. All within the first 30 days. So I was failed by my the docs",1
"HORRIBLE!! This should be taken off the market!! I've had a rash, red peeling all over even where I dont put it. White heads worse than ever... No, just no. My skin burns all the time. IT DOES NOT WORK. I have noticed girls with darker skin or tan skin seem to like this. Those like me with whiter than white skin its wretched on. This is not for all skin types that us for sure. If you want clear skin and have white skin that burns stay away from this waste of money.",1
I was given this medication; when my PTSD related anxiety and panic was too strong for Vistaril to even touch. I've been on BuSpar for almost 8 months with no change in my Anxiety or Panic frequency. I have switched doctors and am now on 0.2mg of Xanax x 2 a day with no complaints. ,1
I took this medication SMZ/TMP for acne/scars on my face.  I had a very severe allergic reaction. My face was swollen and lips. My hands swelled up. I had terrible pains in my wrists up to my arms and pain in my stomach/abdomen.  This happened after taking it for around a week. My dad had to drive  me to the Emergency Room because I couldn't swallow and was almost choking. I was so scared. I warn anyone going on this medication to think twice. I had no idea I would have an Anaphylaxis reaction to it. Very serious. It was Hell going through this and I really thought I would die. I didn't know what was happening to me as I was choking in my sleep. My mom looked up the side effects and that's when we found out it was a terrible reaction.,1
"I've been taking sprintec for 3 months as prescribed after a surgical abortion as a birth control/period regulator. Before starting sprintec my period were on time but extremely heavy. I had been on lo minestrin for a few yrs prior to starting sprintec and had a ton of success with that, but my insurance stopped covering it so I had to change perscriptions. I'm on my last few days of month 3 and I have been bleeding everyday for the past two and a half months. It's beyond normal spotting - I use up a super plus tampon twice a day. On my normal periods I use four to five super plus tampons. I thought something was very wrong with me, and I'm still gonna see a Dr, but reading these reviews leads me to believe its just a really horrible medication.",1
"DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE TAKING! Consult with your doctor but also be aware of the side effects involved. Symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, muscle weakness, slowed speech, muscle spasms, twitching / fidgeting, nightmares. Not for everyone.",1
"Horrible medication! It caused me to have medication induced akathesia! I experienced extreme restlessness and uncontrollable tics in my mouth. My legs would continue to jump up and down while sitting! My psychiatrist initially placed me on propranolol to stop these side effects and worked initially. Then, he had to increase the dosage because it came back. Eventually, he had to take me off propranolol and place me on cogentin (Benzotropine mesylate). Cogentin is used for Parkinson disease. That&rsquo;s how bad it got! Never again!",1
"Started on augmentin the day prior to a simple tooth extraction. It gave me a slightly upset stomach but quickly subsided with yogurt/probiotics etc. Took more augmentin after extraction, no upset stomach but noticed tiny bumps on lower half of face and neck. Started to feel hot and kind of itchy, very shaky. Shortly after I started burping and felt hungry like I hadn't eaten in days. An hour after 3rd dose was like a scene from the Exorcist. Never vomited so hard in my entire life, it was painful. Doc said to stop taking it - no duh. Stopped taking augmentin but nausea and exorcist vomiting still here. Face still hot and bumpy, skin itchy. Never allergic to reg. amoxicillin. I want this new med outta my system! NEVER AGAIN",1
I was switched to nucynta 22mg three daily from norco 3  four daily and was told there would not be withdrawal effect. Either the Dr does not know or she lied. The withdrawal from norco was fast and severe. Became very agitated and the pain spread and became worse. Dangerous drug.,1
"I was on depo-shot for a little over a year and lets just say it was one of the worst experiences of my life. At the beginning it was good I thought it was the best birth control I've ever been on no periods thought it would  help me a gain a little weight. Boy was a wrong! Whenever I would have sex it felt like I was being ripped open inside. Then my hair started to fall out, my skin started yellowing ; since you have to get the shot ever 3 months once the hormones are in you there's no stopping the awful side effects that come with this shot. I started to lose a ton of weight due to depression, acne was awful I had a period for 3 months straight. I was only 12 &amp; now I'm infertile! Beware of depo, implant &amp; patch. (Nuva ring n pills recommend)",1
"Took Bystolic 2mg for a month. At first it seemed to be okay. I liked it because it did not make me dizzy but by the third week started getting side effects. First off I was so tired and no energy, thought it was me but no it was Bystolic. Then my shoulder joints started aching and kind of running down to my wrist in both arms. Not too bad but still there, and the last straw with me was when my left arm started to tingle on the outside of my forearm.  Well started cutting them in half so now I was taking 2.2 mg for the last week and it made no difference. Every time I took the pill hours later my arm would start tingling along with the other side effects. Also another thing it made me gain ten pounds in a months time, also bloating.",1
I was on this medication for about four weeks. Only marginally helped blood pressure. My blood pressure was 120/33 and was lowered to 142/90. Developed hives and had to discontinue.,1
This does not help my pain. I have to take Tylenol with it.,1
"I don't think this is working for me...was or in therapy and this was bumped up to 30mg...I still feel anxious, I still worry a lot, I still have bad mood swings...Everyone and I do mean everyone annoys me...I feel bad for being mean all of the time...the only plus is I try to resolve issues by talking it out rather than cutting everyone off.",1
"I started contrive about two weeks ago. By day 2  I was done! The side effects were too much. I was averaging about 3 hours a sleep a night, the sweats were unbearable, I was constantly starving ( a feeling i ever had before). By day 2, I couldn't even stand myself, I felt like the whole world was against me. I am always a very happy person, by day#2 I hated everyone. My friends, family and co-workers saw a huge change in me in less than a week. I decided that I would rather be fluffy and happy than crazy and slimmer!",1
My blood sugar level with Actos is higher then without taking it.,1
"I received the implant in May 2012, I loved it at first. My implant never hurt, I didn't have a scar or anything. However, my mood changed drastically. I went through anxiety, depression and I gained almost 30 pounds. I've always been very active so the weight gain was unexplainable.",1
"Omg help I'm crying so bad this pain is no joke. It itches so bad after inserting the cream. My lips are swollen so bad I can't sleep I inserted the cream at 9pm it's now 11:49 pm and I'm still in pain. My doc told  me to get this never again! Why me lord. I can't walk, can't sit! HELP ME",1
"I hate to be another bad contributor but... I basically, started out fine. No period for the first month. Then I was bleeding for the next two months. The worst part, gave me the most ridiculous acne of my life. I have never broken out on my jaw line ; cheeks before this shot, so that was very strange; painful. I have been off of Depo ; switched to Trinessa am on my 4th pack. I STILL am trying to get my skin normal and regulate the hormone change. And I'm waiting for the dark spots from my acne from months ago to disappear. It's nice to not remember a pill, but because I had such bad side effects I didn't even try to get my second shot. ",1

About this time started having serious panic attacks. I was nervous all the time. Shortly after I was hospitalized for suicide attacks, I felt like something was taking over my body &amp; I had no control.

Did not work at all. ,1
I have been suffering from chronic hives since 1 years. Every night I'm taking cetirizine which makes me to fall asleep. Now I couldn't survive even a single day without taking it. My hives are killing me if I miss a dose.  As you all know tablets are not that much good for health.,1

"I got switched to it because with the birth control I was taking my periods were irregular. Both of the months that I was on this I had two full periods, one in week 3 and one in week 4. I had mood swings and I was emotional the whole time I was on it. And the worst part is that I've weighed the same thing for the past 3 years, and after being on this for 2 months I gained 3 pounds and after 2 and a half months of not being on any birth control I still have it. Two months was way too long for me.",1
"The taste is DISGUSTING. I was on suboxone for years, now have to take this via my insurance. I now have chronic stomach pain and nausea and like others have said, it barely stays in your system. I feel sick every morning until I take it.",1
I've had recurrent bv for 9 months. I've been to my gyno EVERY month. She put me on Flagyl EVERY time and it always came back. Please try this all of you that are tired of fighting bv. I used Nuvessa and Clindamycin and used Norforms all last month and THE BV IS GONE !!! I really think the NORFORMS cured it !! Why didn't my Doctor tell me that a 4 box of this would cure it ?? Sad. They are all about making money.  I'm BV FREE FINALLY !!!,1
"I am a 39 year old woman with a history of DVT who switched from warfarin to Xarelto . Shortly after starting the medicine I began to experience migraines for the first time. After two weeks of being on it, I began my menstrual period as scheduled. The period was severe bleeding 2 days straight, at that point I went to the ER, I ended up with several blood transfusions that were not helping, my hemoglobin was dropping to dangerous levels. The only thing to be done was an emergency uterine ablation. I believe that blood levels DO actually need to be monitored. My blood was so thin I was not clotting. ",1
"I was on this pill for over 2 months and it has been the worst experience. When I first started taking it, it was fine but 2 months into it I started gaining weight.. And gained up to 3 pounds. My breasts went from a b to almost a d cup and hurt all the time. I was super angry and depressed all the time. It got to the point where I did not want to get out of bed and go on with my normal routine. I lost many friendships due to being depressed. I also did not go to school for over 3 weeks. I would never recommend this pill to anyone. I should of not taken it when I saw the reviews the first time. I just switched to a different pill and already lost 2 pounds in 2 weeks!",1
"I don't normally write reviews on this stuff but this was so horrible I had to... if I could put a rating of 0 on this birth control I would.  Not only did it make me a raging bitch for months, it also made me more depressed and anxious than ever before, and gave me the most severe period; in my whole life.  Half way through the second month on this pill, I got mass amounts of break through bleeding and such severe cramps that I ended up going to the ER!! Even after this, my doctor said I should stay on it and finish the pack. No way was I going to put myself through the struggle- I threw it all out. I would NOT recommend this to ANYONE for ANY reason.",1
"Had it in for three hours and the headache and dizziness started. Luckily was able to get it removed within 24 hours, but the headache is still here five hours later. From what I've read, this is a terrible drug and I'm so glad I got it out of my body!!!!",1
"I'm male, 22, and a diabetic on insulin. I developed severe diabetic-onset peripheral neuropathy six years ago and was prescribed Neurontin at that time. I took it for a couple of weeks, and it did not work well for me. I felt nauseous, and my thinking was not clear. An ER doctor prescribed Cymbalta, and that medicine has been a God send. I do have to live with the side effects of sometimes having trouble sleeping and sometimes feeling wonky-headed, but those are easy trade-offs for the complete pain relief that I feel.",1
"My son has been taking this for awhile now.  He is 2.  He is on 22 mg, and 3mg of Melatonin, he gets a little sleepy, before bed, but otherwise it's hard for him to fall asleep, and he is up at 2:30-2:00am every morning. I don't like it. I was on this at one time too, did nothing for me, so now I take Ambien CR.  I have been on Ambien for about 9 years.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I wish I could find something that worked for my son now.",1

I was put on this medication.  By doctors telling me that I heard voices.  When I didn't.  I was put in the hospital.  By a police officer  who thought I wasn't fit to drive. As I was having a diabetic hypo.  He thought I was on drugs.  And locked me in the  hospital for 3 weeks.  I was forced to have injections of invega.

I was recently prescribed this medication and it did not work at all for me.,1
I was given the oral pill because my partner and I had thrush symptoms. Half an hour after taking it my penis was burning. Twelve hours later and I am still in too much pain to think about anything else. I have swollen skin and rash in different parts of my body and one has grown into a blood blister. I would think twice before giving this to a boyfriend as there has to be better ways to get rid of thrush. The pain is going down a bit so I feel a bit better but it is still very painful. I am drinking water and hoping it will pass soon!!,1
"I became pregnant with twins, as I was not informed to refrain from sexual activity for 2 weeks. ",1
Stay away from this medicine!!! It's horrible!!! It caused me to develop depersonalization/depression. It also made me feel anxious and confused. I really haven't been the same since I took it.,1
"After 1.2 years of taking 120 mg of Avapro to control my blood pressure, I realized that what started out as fatigue developed into my becoming almost non-functional shortly after taking it....feeling totally exhausted, sleepy, and poor balance issues.  Didn't control pressure well either.",1
"I was on this for 3 months and only got up to a 30 mg dose. My lips peeled, my face peeled, I got depressed and finally it made me want to die. I am a super positive person, and I don't think I could have felt so bad about myself. And on top of it my skin did not change because I wasn't able to complete the treatment. Stay away.",1
So glad to find this site and to read I'm not the only one who has experienced awful side effects. Only had the one injection and bar a couple of weeks in total I have bled the whole time. This has been going on for almost 2 months now. Starting to affect my relationship. Avoid like the plague if all the other reviews are anything to go by.,1
"Worst medicine ever. I'm not allergic to anything by the way. I was prescribed for a uti and had to stop after 2 days. Migraines, eyeballs throbbed, chest was in excruciating pain, neck pain, upper and lower back pain, stomach and ovary pin, and leg pain, especially in the knees, onto of of that, nausea, loss of appetite, dizziness, the immediate and random need to throw up, and worst of all...a red rash all over my body. To top that off,  and loss of sex drive. I have never had an allergic reaction to a medicine before...I will never take this again. BEWARE!!!!",1
I found that the side effect of lack of appetite was truly terrible  .Food had no taste and I just couldn't eat.  I also didn't sleep well.  I haven't taken a pill in 3 days and I'm still not eating right.,1
"This medication gave me headaches from the very first dose. They lasted 3 weeks. I volunteered to try bunivail, so I stuck it out for 3 full months. I have to admit these have been the worst three months ever. I would sweat all day. Hot yet had the chills, I couldn't enjoy food. I forced myself to eat. I would start having withdrawals 4-2 hours after I took it. The ungodly hunk of slim that was left over after an hour would float all over my mouth. This drug sucks. Today I got put back on subs and I kid you not  I feel amazing. I am normal again, if I missed a dose of two of subs I was fine with this bunivail I had to do more than I was supposed to just to feel normal. I wouldn't recommend anyone to switch to this crap..",1
Just took the pill and already making me sick ,1
I was on gildess for a year when all of the sudden the pharmacy switched me to bilsolvi 1/20. For the last few months I've been experiencing extreme anxiety to the point of jumping out of my skin. I can't sleep. I'm not sure if it's my anxiety or the pill causing my extreme nausea everyday. But it's almost unbearable. I do not recommend this pill. I've been thinking oh man am I pregnant? Because of the nausea. So I thought after months let me look at some reviews. To my amazement there isn't one good review on this pill. I haven't gained weight but I feel like crap. Switching asap!,1
I got pregnant on this pill at 40! Missed four menstrual cycles in less than a year. Find something else to use.,1
"I chose the Skyla after my second child. It was inserted 8 weeks after baby. At the 4 week follow up, they could not find the strings. 2 ultrasounds, pregnancy test, x Ray,  and CT scan later, they located the IUD in my abdominal cavity which required lap surgery to remove! What a disaster!",1
"Honestly, I can't even believe this drug is still on the market.  Sure it may work for a couple weeks, but after I was on this for 3 months back ending in about 2012, I had every side affect listed in the brochure. I literally had to stop by the fire station on the way home from the pain clinic because I felt dizzy and like something wasn't right.  My blood pressure was 184/142.  The problem was it took over 2 months for it to come down, and now it's like 130/82.  This medication also turned my urine black, like blackened blood, that smelled putrid.  I got off the medication, then heard it was pulled due to a class action law suit.  Then I just stumbled on this... Wow!  I guess if your going to be on it, I wouldn't stay on for more than a mo",1
I was on this first with tablets for a fortnight then injections once a month for 3 months. It gave me SEVERE mood swings and forgetfulness. ,1
"I had been taking the name-brand of this contraceptive for probably 18 years.  Then my insurance decided it would only pay for generic.  I started this one in October.  By Thanksgiving I had a raging allergic rash on most of my body.  ER dr wrongly diagnosed me, and after 2 other dr visits and a biopsy, they discovered it was an allergy to this drug.  It is now mid-February, and after 3 rounds of steroids, I STILL have some of the rash.  Torture for sure!",1
"I have Shingles, on the 2th day I had pain so bad I could no longer sleep, a rash on left side front and back. I started on an antiviral on the 3rd day, which now at over a week is starting to lessen the symptoms of pain and red rash with blisters. But that gabapertin did not help at all with the pain, and caused anxiety and irritation. I asked my doctors office, to take note of it for the manufacturer, but they said they don't do that, that its up to the manufacturer, which made no sense, if the doctors who prescribe it don't inform the manufacturer, how would they know? The medicine is bad news, and didn't work for me at all, worse that that, it made me feel worse.",1
Zyprexa withdrawal is the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my 22 year old life. I took 2.2 mg for 2 years. Sure it helped me sleep for a few months and that is why I did not know what was causing the terrible grief and over all health problems I was experiencing. I was fainting without warning because of this drug. It ruined my life and I have not touched zyprexa in almost 2 years! It is a drug so terrible it should not be prescribed to anybody. The makers of this drug should be totally ashamed of themselves. They really should be punished for what they have done and continue doing to peoples lives with this drug. No joke.,1
"I started taking sigmapharm brand liothyronine. Almost immediately I got terrible tremors that last for hours. I was taking a very low dose 22mcg. After a week I also got a hypoglycemia attack, and I am not diabetic. Discontinuing and going to try perrigo brand liothyronine.",1
This is my second go around with this medicine. My sugars stay in the 200's. It makes me eat ALL the time!,1
"Orsythia was also given to me in place of my usual Lutera. I have never experienced side effects of any kind with Lutera, but Orsythia has caused me to have frequent headaches, moodiness, and full-blown menstruation in the second week of active pills. ",1
"The label with dosage information is not clear. Under the last bottle I bought, the label was very clear: 3 ml not to exceed 2 doses per day. The new bottle dosage says: 20 ml every 12 hours. So which is it? 3 as needed, or 20 every 12 hours. Plus the direction information is under one of those peel corner tabs. It is very difficult to peel the corner off without destroying the dosage information and directions. I had to call a pharmacist to get an answer as to how much I should take. First pharmacist said  2 Tbls = 3 ml. Then another said 2 tsp = 3 ml. Very confusing label.",1
"Diovan 80mg was prescribed to me. It did nothing for my blood pressure. I started on 120mg/12.2, this increased my BP from 140/90 to 120/32 and gave me serious side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, etc. My sister takes this medicine without any problems.",1
"I started on the patch because of menopause (at age 32, no medical reason i.e. surgery). I used the patch for about 2 weeks and had to stop because of a rash at the application site. This was no surprise because band-aids give me rashes too. I had no problem with 0.2 but when moved up to 0.22 I started with the rash.",1
I had been on Latuda for two months.  Great medicine except I had severe muscle weakness.,1
"Im so happy I'm not alone here with saying this pill is absolutely awful. I've always had ok skin, but I get bad cystic acne, and got on this pill for this main issue. I've had bad stomach issues, but thats another story- I just wanted my face cleared up. I cry over how bad my face has gotten in the month I've been on this pill. My doctor told me it would take 3 weeks to work, yet told me 3 whole packs (3 months) a different time. I wish I never got on this. I was on Yaz for a month and it did wonders for my face, but made me incredibly nauseous. I'd rather go back to that in all honesty. Wish I read these reviews sooner. Don't go on this pill if you are looking to clear up acne, I'm worried about going off it now, what it'll do to my skin",1
"I took Seasonique for one month and the side effects were have been so debilitating I had to stop.  My side effects: weight gain of 2+ lbs in one month, breast tenderness, constipation accompanied by gas and bloating, lethargy spanning from feeling &quot;run-down&quot; to complete exhaustion where I slept for 19 hours, extremely painful cramping with diarrhea.  When I started bleeding the cramps were worse than ever before (part of the reason I began taking Seasonique was to lessen the pain and cramping associated with my cycle).  The cramping has been debilitating for 4 days now and is only mildly relieved with Pamprin.  My intention was to ride out the adjustment period but I couldn't and stopped taking the medication 2 days ago.",1
Worst experience ever!!! I had almost everyone's HORRIBLE side effects . Do not use this. I was given through an infusion with 20 mg benadryl and toradol. Never again!!!!,1
I was diagnosed as bipolar 2 20 years ago and use lithium as mood stabilizer. After a period of discontinuation of drug I switch to depakote and after that I have disk herniation problem and ear pain .,1
I was hoping it would help with acne and birth control but I have gained 2 pounds in 2 weeks and acne is WORSE and no sex drive. ,1
"Left Lexapro for Viibryd. First few weeks were fine. After about 2 weeks on 40 MG the terrible symptoms hit. Insane irritability, hostility, anger, anxiety, panic attacks, etc. My doctor with over 40 years experience told me not to even bother with a slow reduction. Just stop the medicine ASAP. He recommended taking 3 MG only if I felt withdrawal symptoms.  This was destroying my life.",1
I was diagnosed with UC and Crohn&rsquo;s almost 14 years ago when I was 2. I exhausted my treatment options this year so I was approved for the biological Humira. After the initial loading dose I thought I was seeing improvement but it was hard to tell as I was also on prednisone to control my flare. After my second two injections I woke up the next morning with my symptoms in full swing again. I know it takes time to start working so I just went with it. About a week later I started experiencing bad back pain and thought I had pulled a muscle when I went to the ER they found multiple pulmonary embolisms in my lungs and kept me in the hospital for 9 days (they never found the cause for this so I say humira ) then back 2weeks later for a UC flare,1
"I had Mirena inserted in 3/2/12 for heavy vaginal bleeding. I am 20 have had 2 children and have to say the insertion was painful. Since insertion I have been bleeding non stop along with heavy cramping and low back pain. The side effects have been horrible for me.. I have had major mood swings, anxiety, decreased appetite and no desire for sex whatsoever. I have recently been experiencing a stabbing pain in my right side which leaves me doubled over in pain for a short time. I had an ultrasound to make sure the Mirena did not move and was causing this pain to occur. Thankfully all results came back ok.. I have an appointment on 11/3 to have it checked but I am going to ask the doctor to remove it at that time.. not worth it to me.",1
"I have hyperemesis gravidarum. Never have I experienced relief with Zofran, minimal, if at all. Constipation goes hand in hand with this drug and I'd rather have N&amp;V all day than be as constipated as I am right now. You have to weigh your pros and cons with this drug, and it's not for me.",1
I paid a doctor $22 online thru Contrave website and $30 for the medicine.  I've been doing exactly as prescribed with zero results.  I can't even tell I'm taking anything.  I have been on it for 2 months.,1
Save your money. Doesn't work,1
Did nothing to help my depression. Made me feel suicidal and zombie like,1
Threw weeks after the initial start of this birth control I lost all my hair and still losing. I asked the doctor will it affect my hair and they said it would not and it definitely did. I'm distraught. Still no period it it's going in two months. I'm worried this implant did servere damage to my body. I wish I never put that bc in my arm.,1
I have received Remicade infusions to treat Crohn's. Felt bad right after the first infusion but was convinced by my physician to continue. I have also received Prolia by injection to treat osteoporosis. I decided to stop the Remicade after 3 infusions as I could feel no benefit and had felt very ill throughout. 2 months later I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer - this is in spite of having annual mammograms. I can't help but think the Remicade is linked to the eruption and rapid spread of my cancer. Beware!,1
Still delivered prematurely at 29 weeks! The injections were painful and the side effects were terrible. It's unfortunate that Makena is so expensive and ineffective.,1
I took this about 3 years ago for a massive mental breakdown I was having panic attacks multiple times a day I couldn't get out of bed I couldn't leave the house I couldn't eat I couldn't do anything I was prescribed this and ativan and eventually after probably a month of horrid horrible experience I started to come out of my anxiety depression all of it I came off of the drug probably a couple months later and was completely fine for about 2 years with just normal anxiety that I could manage. I tried it again a couple weeks ago for the same reason and it was hell was suicidal within the first 3 days in every side effect I can think of I discontinued immediately now looking for something else ,1
"I've used this product before with no problems.   However, I took a dose at 2AM this morning because of a nagging cough and have been extremely sick ever since.  Horrible diarrhea, dizziness and nausea.  Sitting in bed with a trash can next to me wishing that I would just throw up so I'd feel better.  I hope this doesn't last 12 hours.  I'm getting to old to waste a day in bed.",1
"Age 23. I had my 1st Mirena at age 18 due to very heavy and painful periods. The first 3 years my period had stopped (can't remember after what month)  with just a few days of spotting here and there. During the last 2 year of my Mirena insertion, my period returned. They were normal when compared to my periods before the insertion. So I had a new Mirena inserted 12/14/12. It's been 2 months and  I have had very heavy periods every month with painful cramps. I have to empty my menstrual cup every 3 hours (when nomal periods can go 12hrs without emptying). I'm going to wait another month to see what happens but I might switch to the pill if this continues. Has anyone's period stopped after 2 months or a year?",1
"this scary because I had a blood transfusion because of heavy bleeding, I thought I would get relief but no. I have been in pain since day one  I would deal with everything if it would just stop my bleeding .The cramps are so severe Ibuprofen isn't even working I'm definitely switching . I would advise ladies to take note of all these stories because if I had saw this I wouldn't take this at all. I'm in hell right now",1
"Terrible did nothing for pain, all I did was sleep and feel letharigic. Pain increased dramatically, I am totally miserable.",1
Did not improve nausea.   It gave me a migraine like headache.,1
"Two weeks had flu symptoms. Went to ER next day with horrible headache, fever, body aches.  Tested positive for flu and prescribed Tamiflu. Took right away w/ food and felt even worse! Throwing up, acid in my stomach, insomnia and then got the panic attacks and depression.  I did some reading and there can be issues with this w/Tamiflu.  I am not on any anti-depression medication or anything.  But I actually felt like I could die and it would be better.  The thoughts racing through my head were horrible.  Dr. gave me Ativan to help me sleep and calm down. Only took 1/2 pill at night to help sleep.  I got over the flu after about 2 days.  Another 2 days of feeling bad from flu would have been better than what I experienced. Never again!",1
I've been contrave for almost 2 months I haven't lost a single pound I still get hungry. Oh my goodness the sweating is horrible please help I don't know if i should give up on it.,1
"I was diagnosed with pneumonia and was given levaquin 220 mg for 3 days. I'm on day 2 and everyday I get fever, shivers and chills not to mention the extremely bad headaches!!I'm going to let levaquin go !! I am going to throw the rest of the pills. I have no idea how do they prescribe it!",1
"I was 120mg. Was great for my mood, but I had several side effects including: increase blood pressure, tachycardia, urinary hesitation, constipation, bloating, stomach pain, dry mouth, nausea, and UTI. My Dr. told me to choose whether I wanted to feel good mentally or physically. Looking for new Dr. I think I deserve both.  one without the  other is simply existing,and I want to live life happy and healthy.",1
"I'm glad it works for most people - it most definitely did not work for me. My doctor warned me about feeling tingly but that wasn't all-I took it at night like I used to do with Imitrex.My migraine had progressed to the point of not being able to function, nausea-the usual. I woke up and felt groggy, probably shouldn't have gone into work and DRIVE my kids to school but, the pain was done, it was a good 12 hours since I had taken the medication so I figured I was OK. Boy was I wrong. I could not function, my brain was dead BUT the worst part was the uncontrollable sobbing. I was crying for no apparent reason, for HOURS- The whole day! I had to leave work and have my mom pick up my kids and take care of me-nausea lasted all day too. NOPE!",1
"I advise you all, to not take this pill. It is an absolute nightmare. If you wish is to cry all day long, get angry at everyone, have other people mad at you for being emotional, not be able to do anything with your life, and generally if you are wishing for misery, then this is the pill for you. But I would like to take revenge against the people who invented this pill. They knew if they up the estrogen dose on the pill their patients would need to be prescribed antidepressants which - CHA-CHING!! - is a plus for them as their eyeballs look like this ($) ($). This goes for Loestrin Fe too, which I am on now.",1
Started the depo shot in May 2012 haven't had another shot since and still dealing with constant sometimes very very heavy periods and its February 2012...2 MONTHS!,1
"I HATE THIS BIRTH CONTROL. First month if taking it and my face completely broke out like I've never broken out before. My depression and anxiety was off the charts, also I had low sex drive. I was not happy with this. Don't take this BC you'll regret it!",1
"I would just like to point out that I wasn't taking this birth control for protection while having sex. I am a lesbian. I was taking this medication to help with the severity of my periods. When I first started this BC, everything seemed great. This was my third time switching pills so I thought I finally found one that was great. After three months this was sadly not the case. I became very angry and furious at everything and everyone for no reason. This pill made me extremely depressed and anxious so bad that I could barely sleep. I almost ended things with my spouse because I was so angry at her (for no reason). Cramps are horrific and I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital. I am giving up on BC completely",1
"I switched to this pill from Jolessa (Seasonale generic) because I was sick of the non-stop bleeding. Sprintec did stop the bleeding within two days or so, and I haven't had any problems with it for about two weeks. However, near the end of the second week, I had some spotting. I kept taking the pill at the same time everyday, but all this did was make the bleeding worse. I've already ruined three pairs of underwear and one of my pajamas because this pill gave me the heaviest breakthrough bleed I have ever had. Every morning, I would wake up with excessive bleeding. It was that terrible, and made me anxious every time I left the house that I would bleed through my clothes. I wish I had never taken this pill.",1
"3 weeks into taking this birth control I experienced severe anxiety, debilitating panic attacks that sent me to urgent care and kept me from working, depression, sensitivity to light and sound, racing heart, insomnia, and a complete personality change for the worse. My family didn't want to be around me. I stopped taking this drug 4 days ago and already feel a tremendous difference. I no longer have anxiety about going to bed at night, or driving on fast roads, or anything else that used to shut me down before. I have noticed a difference in my outlook on life, my personality, and it's only been 4 days. My doctor told me it can take a week to get completely out of my system but I am seeing improvement everyday. Consumers BEWARE of this drug.",1
"I had a problem in October.. went back for a follow up November 12, 2016 and the clinic kept trying to convince me to get on birth control.. I refused but then they told me about the depo shot.. you won't get your period for 3months, you won't get pregnant, you can have sex without worries that's rubbish! I regret ever taking this shot! I started bleeding in December and it hasn't stopped! It started with brown spotting and now I'm bleeding bright red heavy blood! This is ridiculous! My boyfriend and I haven't had sex ever since the bleeding because it makes the bleeding worse! What was the point of this injection?! I am scared I will never stop bleeding.. I called the clinic and they said I should stop bleeding once it wears off (January 27)",1
"Anytime you go into an ER with a migraine the doc will automatically try an avoid real meds and instead says we're gonna try reglan which has a sedative effect and then add Benadryl and knock you out, turn off the lights and close the door for Dark and quiet. Good thing for any kind of headache. About thirty minutes later the doctor rushes in flips on the light and says how's the headache? At thirty minutes of sleeping your just starting to hit REM. You're groggy from the sedative effects therefore not thinking clearly so you answer like um ok I guess. Great lets get you outa here.On the way out as you're waking up you realize the pain is still there but too late. Reglan is great for the Doctors but does nothing for the patient.",1
"I took Yaz for 3 days and stopped immediately after that.  On the 3rd day of taking Yaz, I experienced numbness and tingling in my left arm and hand.  I felt some heart palpitations, but then it stopped.  On day 4, I woke up still feeling that numbness and tingling, and started to feel my heart race so quickly, I also got shortness of breath. I felt sick, so I went to my pharmacist who told me to stop the pill and see a doctor.  At this point, I started to feel a little better. I went to the medical clinic and saw a doctor who checked my heart rate, which turned out to be elevated.  The rest of the check up was ok, said to go to hospital if Inhave bad reactions again.  So sorry that I took this pill in the first place.",1
"I was switched over to this medication after taking celexa for 6 years and a trial run of cymbyax. I know you have to wait for medications to work, so I stuck it out.  2 months later and nothing had changed. My anxiety gets so bad that I actually crash (sleep, fatigue). It's like my mind goes 100 mph and I go just as fast. My anger outburst got worse as my anxiety kicked into high gear after taking this. Just because it didn't work for me doesn't mean it won't work for the next person! It works great for my sister in law, but for me it just made things worse.",1
"Worst medication ever! First time taking it I had PVCs and then the second time had rapid heart rate, headaches, mood swings, and couldn't catch my breath. Normal things were hard to do. NP cardiologist said it is an adverse reaction that she's seen with this name brand. Stopped it and going to a none hormonal IUD.",1
"Mylan patches do not stick as well as the Qualitest ones, which work great. Pharmacist tried to give me the Mylan as substitute, said to use a bandaid to hold them on...been on the Qualitest ones for several years.",1
Did absolutely nothing for my back-muscle pain.  ,1
"I'm a regular user of my old birth control for 2 years but went to a new doctor for my annual exam and she had me take this. HORRIBLE. First week on this stuff and my face is just COVERED with pimples, my face is itchy/irritated, and I feel awful. Never experienced this with my old birth control. I know it's only been a week and give it time and whatever. Yeah, no way. I'm just going to finish this month and go back to what worked. I'm writing this review to confirm that I experienced acne as a side effect of this pill.",1
Only made me sleepy after taking 6 throughout the day to try and subside anxiety.,1
"This medication can damage liver function. I was prescribed with Lamisil, after 3 days, I discovered my urine turned into dark tea color,  I fell into sick. I go my liver test result came back, it showed my liver was damaged, it's 3 times beyond more than the normal result. I wasn't able to continue to use Lamisil. I also checked if I got any kind of hepatitis, the results came back which indicated that I had never been affected with any kind of hepatitis. Eventually it took me almost 1 year to recover from using Lamisil.",1
"2 months ago my insurance informed me they no longer cover Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo (that had no side effects)  and would basically have to switch to the generic form, Tri-lo sprintec. Being assured that it was the same thing and that keeping ortho would cost about 120, I went ahead and took the generic. I could only make it through 1 and a half packs before I couldn't take the side effects anymore. I was gaining a lot of weight for no reason, constantly bloated, breaking out, fatigued, suddenly depressed for no reason, spotting and even my period just starting for no reason! I finally finished my second pack today but my period started a week ago. Told the pharmacy to switch me back, worst BC, not the same as ortho lo.",1
Headaches. Back pain. Nausea. Cramps. Periods heavier and longer than without it. Heavy spotting a week or two after my period. Absolutely horrible. Ratings are 3/10 everywhere. Unsure why it's still being prescribed if so many woman suffer symptoms.,1
"It ruined my life. I am pretty sure that I was blessed with every negative side effect I could get from it. I got it inserted a month after having my daughter, I had lost 10 pounds of my baby weight, and with no diet change gained that all back with this birth control and then some. I went from 130 to 162. I have horrible depression. I am always fatigued. I have horrible control over my eating and cravings. My anxiety is so intense I can hardly drive anywhere. I have no sex drive and get mad at my husband when he wants it. I am overly sensitive and extremely moody. My hair is thinned and falling out even after switching too better (and pricier) hair products. My skin is always gross. I get one UTI after another (my first ones at that).",1
The only thing this med did was make me yawn 24/7,1
"Well, it seemed like a good decision at the time. Insertion was fine- one mind numbing cramp but over pretty quickly, but I've always been pretty easy when it comes to periods and the like. By day three I was feeling well enough to have sex, despite the dryness. Day four- learned that post-sex cramps are apparently a thing; with IUDs. So that was fun (not) Day five- horrible dryness and, what's this? Day six-a yeast infection?! Is that a side effect of skyla? I don't remember reading that.. Oh, apparently vulvavaginitis&quot; aka any sort of angry vaginal infection includes yeast infections, and occurs in like 20% of users, way more with Skyla than Mirena. Preventing pregnancy by vaginal hell-fire! Not a satisfied customer.",1
"Did not notice any relief in pain.  I did develop welts on my face, hot eyeballs, itching like crazy, nauseated most of the times.  I also felt as though I constantly had the flu.  I would like to back on Norco 10/322 x 6/day or oxycodone 12mg /6 day.  oh- severe constiptation. Really disappointed!!",1
"I'm currently on my 2th week of Differin. Things aren't looking up. I'm in college and I'm currently interning before I get into med school - this means everyday practical exams and everyday patient evaluation. I've lost all my self esteem - I wish I never went on Differin in the first place. Should I stop it? I was said it took 6-12 weeks to see results, and improvement right after the first month. That never happened and honestly, I no longer want to return to my dermatologist. It was an absolute waste of money and time.  My face is exploding with cysts, especially on my nose. And I hate seeing my patients like this. What should I do?",1
I have been on this medication for two months.  I was given Natazia to control my heavy periods and painful cramps.  Month one I still had heavy cramps and flow for seven days.  Now in month two my period has been 11 days and heavy each day. My flow and cramps are actually heavier now.  Extra strength Tylenol is not strong enough.,1
I gotten my first shot around Sept/Oct of 2012 and I bled ALL THREE MONTHS . December of 2012 I was due for a second shot and I decided not to go get my second shot . And ever since then I've been bleeding off and on . It would stop for couple hours and then back to bleeding . I had a typical white discharge one day and when I went to go shower I was bleeding through my pants . And I'm only 18 YEARS OLD !!! The depo shot has completely ruined my periods . Does anyone know if you can get an infection from nonstop bleeding ?,1
Useless. Tried for several days on torn rotator cuff and hip labrum. Thought I could get same relief from ibuprofen but maybe without the nosebleed side effects. But got no relief at all. Waste of $20 coupon. Notice many of the positive reviews are from those also using OxyContin.,1
"This absolutely did not work for me. I had changed from gildess to Junel for some reason by the pharmacist. Within a week of starting the pack, I had daily nausea, terrible skin, and became incredibly depressed. I had awful hot flashes while sleeping. Finally after about 7 months I stopped taking it and asked for gildess back. I wish I had asked earlier, within days I went back to normal and my mood improved tremendously. Would not recommend! If you are experiencing this get off it ASAP!",1
Was given this for a stomach bug and if anything it made my nausea worse. I don't recommend.,1
Gained 60 lbs in under 9 months while taking this.,1
Took it for a few days but could not stay awake and swollen knees making it hard to walk and pain seemed to intensify.  Stopped taking it as needed to be awake to drive,1
"I am 37 with multiple illnesses, fibromyalgia, diabetes, arthritis, and schizophrenia being the tip 4. My Doctor put me on 300 mg of Lyrica 3 times a day. Initially, it stopped my severe symptoms of fibromyalgia, initially. I began to have sleeplessness, which became 3 hrs of sleep every other night. My legs from knee down began to tingle, then it felt like worms crawling in them. I had fuzzy vision, and then 60 voices came out in my head, very loud and clear. My Doctor refused to stop lyrica, I stopped taking it and within a month the side effects disappeared.",1
"Husband has turned in to a angry hulk. I know most of since these comments are  positive on here. But my husband raged and changed into being abusive , and blowing up at a drop as a dime. Don't recommend at all. He is only 30 ...Stopped headaches but turned in to depressed , paranoid, and angry.",1
"After 1 shot started diarrhea, scalded my skin and it  made open sore. Lower right back started hurting. Day 17 I'm waiting on blood work before I take a second shot and my neck at the base hurts. Weird pains I'm not used to that hurt and affect my life quality. Can't take statins. Don't  think I'll ever take another shot of Repatha.  If it messes with your liver it can kill you. Will walk at least 60 minutes a day every day. Continue watch fat and trans and cholesterol.  Last shot 27 days ago. Between initial post and now, I'm still nauseated. Loose bowels every time I eat I have to go. Can't go anywhere. And physically irritating. Still knees and back pain and behind my eyes, trouble swallowing, body spasms. Still so tired and no energy and have trouble.",1
"I've been taking this for one week so far, it has no effect on my appetite. In fact I feel like I am MORE hungry",1
"I have just experienced the worse night of my life due to 10 mg Belsorma. I read reviews, thought they had to be exaggerated..this medicine should not have been approved. Horrific hallucinations/nightmares.. Didn't know if I was awake or asleep . Terrifying. If you are contemplating using this drug, do not do it!!",1
Please please please don't use! Omg I wish I found this before inserting the God damn ovule! For two hours already I'm in worst imaginable pain and discomfort! I'm out of my mind!!!!!!!!!!! Trying to endure hoping it will subside but seriously considering rinsing/removing this curse of medicine I paid almost $20 for!!!,1
"So I was able to get through day 6 of using. Monistat 7. Tonight, the cream started coming out and the crazy burning started. Had to go wash it off. I don't know what the hell is in this cream that's worse than the yeast infection itself! Never again. Going to the gyno for something else if this yeast infection doesn't go away completely with these 6 days of torture. The only reason I endured those 6 days was that I'd wash the stuff off in the morning after peeing. Once that stuff started coming out, I would just shower.",1
"Started using lisinopril stopping water pill due to night Terrors.  BP went down the first week the went back to high so they doubled my dose to 20mg a day. My. Face has a burning itch around the face near the ears, horrible cough all day and night, also none stop headache. I really dislike drugs I mean really..... what's the long term effects?

"I am 67 years old, postmenopausal for 9 years, with typical vaginal dryness but no other issues. No problems with either Vagifem tablets or Estrace cream in the past. I had more vaginal discharge with Yuvafem. After 2 months on Yuvafem I developed vaginal spotting, fever, and a kidney infection! Was treated with oral antibiotics, and within a couple of days the vaginal spotting stopped as well. My GYN has since found a benign cervical polyp and attributed the spotting to that, but I'm not convinced. I have never suffered from UTIs so this was too much of a coincidence. I believe the excessive discharge from Yuvafem led to bacterial overgrowth, spotting, and subsequent urinary tract/kidney infection. I'm back to Estrace cream.",1
I recently had a colonoscopy and was directed to take Moviprep.  If you are on antidepressants or have a very sensitive stomach do not take this product.  I drank only half a litre and the effects were very negative.  Moviprep cleaned my stomach of everything including the anti depressant I am taking (Celexa).  My body went into withdrawal and I had a huge panic attack.  My doctor suggested I take Florastor to restore the good bacteria in my stomach which allowed my body to once again absorb Celexa and allow it to take effect.  After four days of taking Florastor the panic attacks stopped and so did the nausea.,1
"After sucessfully taking Avinza 120 3x daily I was selected to try Embeda 120. I took my 1st dose shortly after leaving the Pharmacy. Stopped for a take-out sandwich. When I reached home I started feeling strange...by the time I walked into my kitchen I heard a loud sound like cicadas in the trees...thought &quot; this is springtime, what are they doing out? Then I realized the sound was in my head. Got super dizzy, barely made it to the bed before experiencing instant, total withdrawal symptoms. And no, I didn't crush the Embeda  just swallowed it. I writhed around the bed for 8 hours in violent convulsions, badly hurting my knees which needed replacement. Found out later I was one of the 8-12 % who carry an enzyme that releases the Naltrexone",1
"I suffer from anxiety/panic disorder and I was given Buspar 10 MG twice daily.  I felt very light headed and like I had a constant head rush. My Dr tried increasing the dose to 20mg twice daily and with that I couldn't keep my eyes open.  I had to nap for 2 to 3 hours.   It was just awful.  After nearly 4 weeks of being on this medication, I have insisted that I been taken off of it.  I am on 2 MG twice a day for today and tomorrow and then I'll be done with it and I hope the side effects go away soon.  Just an awful experience.",1
I had my 8th child in Nov/2012.I  received a depo shot before I was discharged. I had a quick break between postpartum bleeding and my period.  Then all sudden now my periods are 2-3 weeks long.  :( I'm on day 9 right now. Still bright red blood with no ending in sight.,1
"I haven't used this for very long, probably less than a week, and I know your body's suppose to get use to it however after reading these experiences I don't think my symptoms are gonna change. I'm not sure how effective the pill is for sex because I used it to calm down my periods however ever since I've started using it I get pains in my lower stomach. they feel like period pains and the pill has put my whole mood down. I do get acne kinda normally however i broke out so much on my forehead and I'm almost positive it's from this pill. it's Thursday and I started it Sunday and I've gained probably 2-6 pounds already. it literally makes me hungry 24/7 which is a nono. i'm either stopping all together or switching to a new pill.",1
"I just completed my third month on Junel. At first, it made my skin experience the worst acne I have ever had in my life. I experienced tons of tiny breakouts all over my face, and cystic pimples, both things I have never seen on my face before. I decided to give it time, because many say your skin needs to get worse before it gets better; however, after three months it never did. When I would go on my placebo weeks, my skin would clear, and when I started the pill it would break out again. I would not recommend taking this medication for acne. In addition, I noticed terrible mood swings while on this medication. Many of my friends and family remarked that I was hostile at times. I felt deep depressions that I have never felt before.",1
"I started burning and itching after taking a antibiotic. Co-worker recommend this product, said it worked great for her. This didn't help me at all. 2min after inserting the application I started burning more. Luckily I was able to get most of the ointment out, the burning eased after that. I guess this only works for some people",1
"Since I've started taking this pill my mood has been all over the place, I've been crying, and sad all the time, and I'm a really happy person, I never have acne and now I have acne is really bad I feel bad! It's been only one week.",1
"I had UTI, usually it goes away with OTC Azo and water, but this time I could not get rid of it. So I went to the ER. They gave me Bactrim. 2 a day for 2 days. I took the entire round of them and nothing changed. The medicine itself made me sick as a dog. I could eat with it or not eat with it and it didn't matter. I was still so nauseous. It gave me chills and made me dizzy as well. I wouldn't give this to my worst enemy!",1
"I unfortunately had to remove my wonderful IUD and was forced to resort to taking birth control pills.  I have taken them in the past before I had my child so I didn't think it would be an issue.  I have been bleeding since the day I started taking ranging from spotting to heavy.  My breasts are so swollen and painful, it is miserable.  I have had random cramps that are debilitating.  The doctor switched me to the Ortho Cyclen today, hoping that helps.  I have never been this uncomfortable before. I feel swollen and bloated everywhere. I have taken 3 pregnancy tests because it just seemed within a week my body was acting like that of a 9 month pregnant person, all negative thank goodness. Getting back on the IUD as soon as possible.",1
"I have had fibromyalgia for over 10 years and have tried almost everything for it with no relief. The Cymbalta and Lyrica helped a little, but not enough. I started on the Savella 9 days ago and had to stop on the 7th day. Yes, it did help incredibly well with the pain, but the side effects I was having were worse than any amount of pain. I was only sleeping 2 hours a night, if that. I just really didn't feel like I was all there and I couldn't even function in my every day life. For now, I'll be dealing with the pain and hoping these side effects go away very soon. Good luck to all of you who try it.",1
"Please avoid Tri Lo Sprintec. I've been on it for one month, and it has cased me to bleed every single day. I also had my period fifteen days after my last cycle (not normal). It's also caused dizziness, nausea at all hours of the day (to the point where it wakes me up in the middle of the night), and fatigue. Please research any birth control before you agree to taking it. Listen to your body when you notice changes after beginning this prescription.",1
"After taking this cough syrup, I woke up and I experienced the most awful panic attack. Fingers tingling, feeling 'weird' thinking I was at deaths door. The only explanation was the cough syrup, I was pondering whether to call 911 and didn't because I KNEW it was the Delsym and it probably would pass with time. Drank a lot of water to hopefully flush it out faster. I will NEVER take Delsym again. Would like to know what ingredient gave me such a violent reaction.",1
"My two year old had the Flu Mist vaccine on a Monday morning.  By Monday evening he had a fever, no energy or appetite and wanted to go to bed.  Tuesday his temperature spiked to 104.2 and he had achy arms and legs, head and tummy.  Still had a fever all day Wednesday but started taking fluids again, still not eating.  When he was one he had the shot and had no reaction.  I think we'll stick with the injection from now on.",1
"Horrible! I have been a smoker for 14 years.  I tried chantix and the dreams are so bad I didn't sleep but a hour or so a day for 21 days before going crazy from sleep deprivation. I attempted to harm myself multiple times, lost my job &amp; boyfriend, I had to send my kids off because I feared what I might do. I trusted nobody cause I feared they were all out to get me. I couldn't breathe, my whole left side went numb for a week...this medication ruined my life and I'm still a smoker (which I feel safer doing)",1
"I have had the worst experience with this pill! Took just one pill of it, and my head started blasting like crazy! Bad bad headache, almost felt I was about to pass out, just wanted to go to emergency room! I couldn't do the 2 per day! It's expensive and bad side effects. Not worth it! Would probably get phentermine!",1
"I took chantix a little over a month. It made me have a psychotic split, now I have to take medication for the rest of my life. To say I wouldn't recommend it is putting it lightly. This DRUG shouldn't be allowed on the market.",1
This medicine kept me from sleeping the whole 2 days I was on it. My body just started to shut down and my eyes would just close but my mind would not let me go to sleep.,1
"I was prescribed Nucynta for severe neck/shoulder pain. After taking only 2, 72mg pills I was rushed to the ER with severe breathing problems. I have never had any issues with pain medicines before.",1
"I only tried a sample and not very good tasting. Price is around $200 per bottle, a month's supply I guess. Also, Medicare doesn't cover it and no coupons. Not sure if it would help, but it's too expensive for me.",1
"your skin will clear up while ur on this drug. This drug will screw your gut bacteria so when u stop takin it, ur acne will come back way worse. Avoid this drug at all cost.",1
"It was a nightmare.I had the worse side effects that medicine had to offer. Its been a month and I am still swollen and been to the worthless ER in Grants Pass, Oregon  which is Asante Three Rivers Hospital  where they after 2 1/2 hours diagnoised me with shortness of breath.No treatment for the convulsion the swelling from head to toe, confusion,and the list went on.I was first  turned away from Asante Urgent Care saying they do not treat patients with side effects from Medications.",1
"I'm naturally depressed/anxious, but this medicine has made it so much worse. Panic attacks, headaches, suicidal thoughts. Awful experience.",1
My 10 yr old son would get stomach cramps and diarrhea every time he tried milk. We tried lactaid on two different occasions a few weeks apart and both times caused vomiting. Obviously something in the pills does not agree with him.,1
I took Prozac for 3 months at 10mg to treat depression from bipolar disorder Type I. I felt numb and I just didn't care about much of anything while taking Prozac. I felt very indifferent toward most things. I also experienced a very low sex drive and difficulty in achieving orgasm.,1
Made me jittery and could not sleep. Lost weight but side effects were very bad. Doctor switched me to Belviq. See what happens. No insurance coverage yet. Still fighting for it with them.,1
Took generic Biaxin (200mg 2x a day) / clarythromicin and it quickly made my illness go away but at the expense of crummy side effects. Never had medicine make me have such bad digestive effects (diarrhea) plus severe headaches and spells of dizzyness. After three days called the doctor and he immediately changed my medicine. I do not recommend this medicine at all.,1
Did not work for my moderately high blood pressure.,1
Used this med for my last two pregnancies under doctors med advice. Hated it! All I could do while on this med was sleep. I felt high all the time and my doctor didn't seem to believe me. Maker claims it doesn't effect the baby however I'm not convinced. Only time I felt any baby movement was when I stop taking the medication. When I discontinued to use it I felt as if I was having withdrawals and was forced to continue it. I have four living children of which 2 of them I took zofran for nausea and they were all born healthy. The last 2 pregnancies both ended up in losses. Both had all the genetic testing normal. 1 was 13 wks the other 21 wks. I learned this drug was removed from mrkt for its dangers &amp; reintroduced with minor changes made.,1
My 10 year old son took Dulera for asthma.  In the 8 weeks that he took it he dropped from 62lbs to 26lbs.  He was tired all of the time to the point that he had to lay down often.  He is usually active all of the time.,1
So please don't scratch rub or mess with your vag before using this product FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY anyways I got this product for the first time at first it wasn't bad at all I did it during the day and then took a nap first mistake. So now I know why it says take it at bedtime because when you walk around it leaks and make you look like you pissed yourself.

It burned so bad and the monistat got my vag swollen and in pain,2
"I'm on my 2nd week of taking Aviane, and so far I've been dealing with insanely annoying mood swings. I have been extremely emotional and it made my period last longer than it normally does. Also I got dizzy after my 3rd day on the pill and occasionally get a bit off balance. I'm going to try and stick it out for a few months but after that, if I'm still like this, I'm going to see if I could switch medicines.",2
"I have Mirena for over 2.2 years due to my heavy periods because of uterine myomas. I just replaced new one over a year ago. I had natural delivery of 3 kids, so extraction even with hysteroscopy and insertion was a piece of cake; for me. Did not sense anything. The plus sides are that it does the job and I have no excessive bleeding nor get pregnant or having any physical discomfort at all. However, I have several other side effects. Bad mood, low sex drive, weight gain over 22 kg and never gone down (I got 3 kg in first 3 months after first insertion), insomnia (cannot sleep at all without sleeping pill), my migraine have worsening, all body swelling - particular face and eyes (like I was heavy crying)......",2
"On lithium 800mg, venlafaxine 300mg, mirtazapine 30mg and still nowhere near normal. Currently being treated for depression but have overwhelming anxiety. Am told that I have bipolar disorder.

"I took Solodyn for three years. I had been on Accutane the previous year, it cleared up my skin well, but then I started to get blemishes again. The Solodyn worked well, though I still had hormonal acne two weeks every month.  I was happy with the results.  Then, after about a year of being on it, I left for college and started to have very bad stomach issues. Overtime they worsened, but my doctors could not figure out what was wrong. I saw three different specialist, had colonoscopies, endoscopies, scans, tests, labs, etc. but no conclusions could be made. Then, my dermatologist decided to just take me off the solodyn to see if it had an effect. My stomach isn't 30% better, but I can already tell a difference in my health.",2
"Started with 300 mg Metformin ( took one pill 4 times a day!) in summer 2012 - bad, bad diarrhea. Changed to 30 mg /day Januvia  - only had bad diarrhea - Late summer 2012 started in Invokana - Starting in November I've had 3 yeast infections thru Jan 1, 2012. Also very thirsty - no hair loss - yet! - some leg cramping - painful in the calves of my legs - blood sugar control ok - I used to be 2.0 (for 3 years) on insulin. Then Doc said I'm over 22 so my blood sugarts (A1Cs) should be higher so I don't go low - but in all the years I've entertained diabetes (since 1991) I've never gone low - so I don't understand this concern. Am seeing doc on Jan 9 - have to see where it goes from here - everyone is right about the yeast infections ",2
"I found my experience on Pristiq to be similar to when I was on Effexor XR.  They are very similar medicines.  I switched to Pristiq after I wasn't getting the relief from depression and anxiety anymore on Lexapro and Xanax.  Unfortunately, I've had to discontinue the Pristiq after about 2 months.  It does help with depression but it was making me easily agitated/irritable and I've had considerable weight gain.  I would take it in the morning and often have thoughts of suicide by the time i went to bed.  I have switched back to Lexapro but just added Wellbutrin XL and switched my anxiolytic to longer acting Klonopin.  I've read this is a great combo and hope it works! Good luck everyone.",2

"I have been taking Zoloft for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Depression, and Obsessive Compulsive disorder. It has been seven months since I began taking it. I have been taking 20mg on weekdays, as it does not seem to change the effect of the medication despite what my psychiatrist has said. I feel as if it does significantly improves my anxiety, although I do have bad days. It has not seemed to significantly improve anything else; my Depression and OCD may have actually gotten worse.",2
"I'm definitely losing weight extremely fast with this medication. I took 22 mg at night the first 30 days and I'm now on the start of the third month at 20 mg at night, also, 32.2 mg Adipex every morning. With Topamax I CANNOT eat. Everything I eat makes me sick. It definitely changes you're sense of taste and smell which has pretty much stopped my smoking. So, there are huge benefits just the side effects can be a little unbearable at times. I've lost 28.2 pounds in 2 months",2
"I'm 22, not sexually active and taking the pill as a form of prevention against ovarian and uteran cancers. I've been on this pill for almost two full cycles. Before the pill, I rarely if ever had acne and prided myself on a clear complexion. Now, my face is a war zone, I have awful acne and acne scaring. It has been emotionally devastating and my confidence has dwindled.  Everyone in my life has noticed the drastic change. I feel embarrassed.  My dermatologist said it may take 3 or 4 months for my system to regulate. Overall, I haven't had any other side effects, apart from weight gain.",2
"I am 29 years old and female . Had  or have  type 3. Had to take Sovaldi / Ribavirin treatment for 24 weeks. It was 24 weeks of hell, I think I had every side effect listed and then some. Seriously thought at the beginning the dose was so high I thought I would die, they lowered the dosage because my red blood cell count got so low I had to give myself shots of epogen to fix my blood. But treatment stopped in sept. And in november the hep c is not detected in my blood. But I still have lasting side effects , don't think I'll ever be my old self again. But right now I'm still alive. My advice to everyone is, before you try it read everything you can and talk to your doctor about side effects ! No one told me anything!!",2
"I was on Microgestin fe 1/20 for 4 years. In the beginning everything was fine.  My acne from high school went away, I didn't have anymore cramps, and very light periods.  Now that i'm on my 4th year i noticed that all of a sudden I started getting cystic acne all over my chin area!  I knew that chin acne is a result of hormonal imbalance which confused me since I was on this birth control for years! My dermatologist recommended that I switch to Ocella since its better for acne.",2
"I am hearted by the 2 reviews. I have just started on Deplin. I have been on Remeron for two years. I cannot tolerate serotonin type medicines such as Prozac, Lexapro. Remeron worked beautifully at first but effects have slowly worn off and my anxiety and mild depression returned. I pray Deplin will work for me and I can regain my enthusiasm and joy in life. I am happy for those of you who have been helped. Wish me luck.",2
"I'm on Day 8 of Chantix. I have smoked for twenty years and tried several other methods without success. My best friend is also taking it at the same time. The dreams are vivid. I'm very tired. I've also had headaches which are not typical for me. I'm light sensitive and so dizzy that I feel unsafe driving or working at times. However, I've continued to take one pill a day instead of the two. I'm now on 1mg. I have noticed less cravings. I'm so miserable that I'm gonna stop smoking just so I can quit this medication. Oh and I forget, depressed. Wish you all luck!",2
Okay so this is my first time having a YI I'm 12 and I was so scared at first! I told my sister my situation and she recommended the monistat 2 saying the others didn't work. Well I'm on night 4 right now and that pain is so horrible! The fact that you have to take the cream before bed makes it really hard for me to fall asleep. The pain gets so bad I have to distract myself so I won't burst out into tears. This has been such a long week and I dread every night I have to go to bed ,2

"I saw the ad for Zecuity in a magazine a month or so ago.  The whole process to get the patches takes a long time, 3 weeks to a month or more.  I have migraines maybe every other month, but they can be severe with vomiting lasting two days not counting the migraine hangover afterwards.  I usually take narcotics and have Zofran for the nausea, but if I wake up with a full blown migraine the meds don't stay down even with the Zofran The patch is complicated to set up, but it worked.  Sunday I had a migraine, it didn't work as well and I have a raised red circular welt on my arm that itches like anything.  I am going to the doctor tomorrow so I'll check it out with him.  I hope it works better the next time.",2
"Before tri sprintec I was on ortho tri cyclen lo. With ortho lo I had no side effects, light periods, and no pms. I got my ortho lo from a  family planning clinic that offered it for free to teens with no income. Upon moving to a different state that had no such program, I got a prescription and opted for the generic equivalent--tri sprintec. At first everything was fine and I did not notice a difference. After the first month or so I began experiencing noticeable mood swings that would occur during any time of my cycle. I also noticed an increase in nausea and acne. Part of it was the pharmacy's fault for not giving me the proper supplement (tri sprintec lo) and throwing me on higher dose, but I'd rather just pay more for the ortho lo.",2
"I was diagnosed with IBS-C about a year and a half ago. No laxatives were working at all. I was first prescribed with linzess 142, that did nothing for me. Then my doc upped the dosage to 290. That helped a little more. Then he added Amatiza. I now have to take 2 Amatiza and a 290 for anything to happen for me. The bloating is insane and the water retention is unreal. Living my life constantly sick is no fun!",2
I was prescribed 400mg to be taken 3 times a day for dental abscess and gum boil both of which didn't clear up previously despite taking 2 full courses of amoxicillin. After day two I was awaken by severe pain around my infected tooth and had to to take codeine and ibuprofen just to not to go crazy (this type of pain is an absolute terror). I noticed a strange sensation coming from the affected area and realised it was the abscess actually draining. It just shows how powerful and effective this drug is. You will read a lot of mixed reviews and stories of horrible side effects but don't get put off by it. it is safe and effective when taken as prescribed and it is better so suffer some minor inconveniences rather than indescribable agony.,2

"I had had my Skyla IUD in for over a year and just recently had it removed because it just did not work for me. Insertion was pretty uncomfortable but like previously mentioned in another post, it was doable (I'm sure contractions will be a lot worse than that was haha).  Like I said, I had it for over a year and I had a period every month, most of which my period lasted 2 weeks! Cramping was worse for me while on the Skyla than on any other birth control. After removal, I've been bleeding pretty steady the last few days and cramping which is supposedly normal. I loved the convenience of not having to remember the pill but I don't think I'll be getting another one anytime soon.",2

"I've been dealing with IBS several years, to the point where it has taken over my life; virtually homebound. Started trying the FODMAP diet, which my doctor hasn't even heard of, and was gaining some control over my IBS. Then he gave me some samples of both Viberzi and Creon. The first day I tried both meds, I was a constipated, drugged, crying my eyes out, basket case. It stopped my bowel movements all together. No BM the first day; stomach felt bloated and tight, and I was in a stupor. The Creon SEVERELY exacerbated my depression. Second day, I took 1/2 a pill of Viberzi only and had a really sedated feeling and slept the day away. Not as much belly pain. Thinking about taking 1/4 at bedtime.",2

"I've been having seizures for the last two years, after being free from seizures for 2 years after temporal lobe surgery. I've had a seizure about every three months. Each seizure was worse then the previous one. Last year when I fell complications caused kidney failure. This has passed. I was on Lamictal and Keppra was added, and both were increased, without any change in seizures. 4 months ago I was taken off Keppra and Vimpat was added. 200 Lamictal/400 Vimpat. It is a strong medicine, in the morning I got very dizzy and unbalanced with double vision.  I complained and my dose was split up 3x a day and I feel much better. 4 months free of seizures now, I'm simply waiting for the next seizure, hoping not.",2
"I've had it for almost a month and haven't stopped bleeding or having cramps. I keep reading that it's good for women who have heavy, painful periods, but the adjustment time can take up to six months. It's been a full month and everyday has been like a light period. I'm hoping it stops, and the period goes away altogether like I've read. The transition has been difficult though.",2
2nd review (2nd month on trinessa). In my first review I gave a 1star because I got TONS of cyst acne in the first 3 wks of taking Trinessa. I'm now on my second month and my cysts seem to be slowly disappearing or at least shrinking and I haven't gotten any new cysts. I'm starting to feel a bit more positive with this BC.,2
"This is far from the godsend every one else has claimed it to be. I'm two months in and have witnessed almost no results, other than the zits are less large and less painful. But in no way are their less zits. As an added ;bonus, my acne scare like never before. The scarring is impossible to get rid of and impossible to cover up. My acne was only moderate, so I had expected it to work. I'm frustrated, and disappointed. This was my last hope.",2
"I beg of everyone to think twice before taking this pill. I am 20 years old and took one of these a couple years ago after being constipated for a week, and remember laying on my stomach holding onto my bed for dear life with all four limbs- swearing I would never take one again. I proceeded to go to the bathroom for hours- in pain unlike anything else is experienced. This month, I was on vacation and had barely gone to the bathroom for 24 days!! So I decided I'd try this before going to the doctor! I woke up last night with such bad stomach cramps almost not making it to the toilet before throwing up and pooping myslef at once!!! Puking black stuff up- which I am still very confused about!! I have not moved from bed all day, sick as a dog!",2
"Cymbalta worked for me for years and then, all of a sudden, just stopped working. This is day 8 of Brintellix. Suicidal ideation went down significantly but side effects are awful. I'm hungry all the time and thinking about food the minute I finish eating. Also, I haven't read this as a side effect before, but I believe I'm having some sort of allergic reaction as my limbs won't stop itching. I even took Benadryl for a couple of nights but without much relief. Is anyone else experiencing a similar side effect.",2
"I have been on xulane for 3 months now and I love it. Before I started my periods were bad with headaches, cramping, and heavy flow, after the first month my periods dwindled and now I only need light pads, I rarely cramp and have maybe one headache. However I do get some redness and irritation on my skin, trouble with the patch adhering to my skin and also my eating habits have changed dramatically, sometimes I'll be starving and when I see what I'm about to eat I lose any urge to eat. I would recommend it but be sure you remain aware of your body.",2
"This is a very intense antibiotic with persistent side effects. I have been on this medication for one month and continue to experience nausea and vomiting. I have been fortunate to not experience reddening of my saliva or tears, but other body fluids have changed. My hepatic enzymes have more than doubled baseline values and continue to climb. It does its job well, but it is a tough 4 months to get through.",2
"Been on 2mg once a day for just over 4 months. Mostly wiped out my anxiety and panic attacks, but does nothing for my waves of agitation and irritability. I was reluctant to try it because of the weight gain. Now I regret it, as I have gained 20 pounds!!! I am the heaviest I've ever been and hate it. My pdoc wanted to raise it at last appointment, or try me on another antipsychotic (I didn't realise how heavier I was at that point). I'm gonna choose the latter option when I next see her. The weight gain on this is worse than quetiapine (which I also came off for the same reason).",2
"Olanzapine is great for bringing down a manic episode but can hinder recovery as it made me feel so depressed.  On 2.2 mg and going to come off as it makes me so low and depressed. I sleep  for about 12 hrs and have no interest in anything.  It's helped with my anxiety but would rather feel anxious than live with the depression I am counting down the minutes till the day is over. Previous have done this and have felt better within days, longest I've stayed on it this time but also longest I've felt depressed. Will let you know how I get on",2
Hi all. I am still on the fence on Lemtrada. I know there is no magic pill. It has slowed down the flares. My symptoms seem to have progressed. I guess it is fair to say maybe my expectations were too high?? It has been 2 months. I will update this if I see a shift. Very glad others had good experiences. Baby steps. Thanks,2
"Coming onto this medication at first I didn't notice anything in particular. I was on the train and I just noticed that my disoriented thoughts and feeling super nervous calmed quite a bit. I did notice I didn't talk as much as I did before I started the medication. It helpsx with my depersonalization. But at the same time it adds fuel to my underlying depression that I had in the past. At the same time I believe that's a good thing. Because it's helping me heal hidden broken parts of myself. It especially helps when talking to my therapist about my past. I hate how tired I am, as I am typing this I think I yawned at least 8 times. Delayed orgasms suck as well...but sometimes I take a day off from taking one pill so it's okay.",2
"I was given a 3 day prescription after sinus surgery. The pros are 1) I only have to swallow one pill per day 2) It doesn't bother my stomach (other antibiotics have in the past) and 3) I've not gotten a yeast infection. The con is that it seems to totally dry me out. I take it in the evening, and my mouth/nose/lips are incredibly dry regardless of the amount of water I drink all night long. It is uncomfortable enough to keep me awake. I also experience dryness during the day, but not the same severity.",2
within the first two months on acutane my acne got much much worse but after that it got much bettter although it did leave behind many scars due to the severity of my acne because of the medicine in the first two months ... if I knew this would happen I would've just let my acne play out without the acutane,2
"Works great, almost immediate.",2
"Had Implanon 08/08 - 08/11. From the start, I had spotting/full period 3 weeks out of the month, then two months a year I would have zero spotting or no period at all. No bad side effects until the last year. Started having cramps, heavier periods, and bad mood swings. Over the 3 years I gained 22lbs despite a healthy diet and exercise routine. When seeing my doctor last week to remove it, she instantly commented on the weight gain and said she attributes it to the Implanon. The bleeding and weight gain were just not worth it. It was inconvenient so I am switching back to the pill.",2
"I'm a middle aged woman.  Along with my first hot flash about 3 years ago, came the weight gain.  Since 2008 I had gained about 20 lbs.  Then, in the summer of 2012, I was in a clinical trial for Dasotraline. By the time Phase 1 had ended, I had gained 30 lbs, now weighed 222.  I've tried every combo of diet and exercise through the years,  I threw in the towel and was basically waiting to die. About 3 weeks ago, my head popped out of my butt and I decided I deserved to be happy and healthy.  Back in the gym, clean eating, and no diet soda.  The scale did not move. I had my physical.  Doc prescribed Qsymia.  Insurance did not cover.  My 1st weeks was reduced to $20 not free!!  I've been on for 3 days.  No changes yet  I'l keep you posted",2
"I'm tempted to leave a crappy rating for this type of birth control since I did experience negative side effects, but it did do it's job of allowing me to continue to beat teen pregnancy so I had to give it a little credit. Honestly, Microgestin Fe 1/20 makes you feel like you're the size of a killer whale at all times. BLOATED as anything. Lost lot of energy... aka walking five minutes away to class was like practically climbing Mt. Everest. Also, if you don't take your pill with food, you'll feel about ready to vomit for the rest of the day/night. Gained a whopping 2 pounds in one month while taking this bad boy. Not blaming my weight on the pill itself, but the intense hunger pangs it caused me to have without me even fully realizing.",2
"I have taken this for about a year. I have lost about 40 lbs. I am taking it to help depressed moods. I also have to take the brand and not the generic. I will have late onset asthma with the generics and other unpleasant side effects. I tried more than once to use generics but it won't work. So , give it a try if you can afford the brand name. IT makes a big difference. I also found that all my migraines disappeared while taking this. What a relief that was. ",2
Been taking it on and off because I have high blood pressure. However I am a college student and I suffered from severe drowsiness during the day. I was precsribed 0.1 mg at night. I slept well but during class I was so sleepy I found it difficult to stay alert. I stopped taking it and currently I am on break from school. I restarted the clonidine and I was hoping I would get used to it but I still feel drowsy during the day. On the other hand my blood pressure has still been high its been 4 weeks and I am taking it religiously. I plan to discuss this to my doctor on my next office visit. I am afraid that she is going to increase my dose. I can only imagine how much more drowsiness I am going to feel on a higher dose :(,2
"I had a 2 month sample to try from my midwife because I was tired of taking a daily pill. The first month, I was extremely irritable, angered quickly for no reason. I felt bloated all the time and I started breaking out. After the first month, my skin cleared up, and I went ;back to normal. Overall, it is a great concept, but I can never keep the NuvaRing in place. It constantly moves around and will sometimes stay by the cervix, and other times will fall down and  feel like it's going to fall right out, which I can't stand. I constantly have to go back and push it into place, which is very irritating. My husband said he couldn't feel the ring during sex, but I could feel it moving against my vaginal wall. I am going back to the pill.",2
"I am prone to UTI's and never had a problem with this drug before.  Took my 2 doses on the first day, with what I thought was no problem woke up on day 2 vomiting.  Around 11am I tried a piece of toast, and took my 3rd dose with that. I was then okay til about 4:30, when I was sick again.  I have skipped doses 4 and 2 and am waiting to hear from the doctor about calling in a different prescription.  ",2
"I have been on Lo Loestrin for about 3 months now. Before this one, I was on Safryl. I switched because Safryl was giving me horrible side effects. I like Lo Loestrin, however, I don't love it because the spotting between periods has not stopped. I haven't gained weight, if anything have lost some. My face is clear and my sex drive is okay, not like before, but i haven't lost it. In my experience, this pill has more positive than negatives. I was also diagnosed with PCOS and Hashimoto's Disease. Birth control pills don't have the same effect on everyone. My GYN had me complete a hormone test before prescribing me this pill. He wanted to balance my hormones out with the pill and it looks like he did. I'm hoping the spotting goes away.",2
"I'm 18 and have had pretty awful acne since I was 12. My doctor prescribed Tri-Sprintec mainly for the acne, but also for period regulation and birth control. In the 2 weeks I've been taking it, I haven't experienced any of the mood swings or breast tenderness/growth that others have. I've gained a few pounds, but I'm home from college and so eating poorly and not exercising, so I can't really blame that on the birth control. My acne has gotten 3 times worse since starting, with lots of breakouts on my forehead, chin, and around my mouth which used to be completely clear. As frustrating as it is, I'll stick with it for a few months and hope that my body adjusts and the acne clears up!",2
"I was on Celexa for about a year, gradually had my dosage increased from 20mg, to 40, then to 20, the max. Seemed to help a bit at the beginning of each change in dosage. I had no major side-effects. My crying decreased but I still felt hopeless and depressed most of the time. Not for me.",2
"Have been on Xanax since I lost my brother. I was thirty-nine. It helped with grieving, especially while working. Through the years I've been prescribed Xanax for sleeping .22. Through the years I've developed Fibromyalsia which one symtom is sound, refreshing sleep. After consulting specialists and pain mgt, the decision was use Xanax along with Prozac to get to sleep and stay asleep. Now , after I moved I went to a new dr who refuses to prescribe Xanax. He used the term I am too &quot;old&quot; to keep taking Xanax. Worked fine for many years, now he is changing my mode of life. Today he prescribed vistaril. Will see tonight if I can sleep. He initially cut the Xanax I was using by 2/3. I was prescribed take 3 -.22 mg at bedtime. Hope it works!",2
"Started taking Victoza again,  first time I couldn't handle the side effects (weakness, tiredness, nausea) Now, back on the 12th of August, only taking 0.3, and I feel great, appetite isn't completely gone, but my craving are declining day by day, as for constipation I drink a glass of chocolate milk for snack. As for nausea I wear a band for motion sickness.",2
"I first was prescribed this for my irregularly long painful periods, I would bleed for months without stopping. This first helped an enormous amount. I have been taking this for around 2 years and over this 2 years I have gained 30  lbs. Recently I have experienced random bleeding when any pressure is applied to my abdominal area. Although it works at stopping getting pregnant, you get what you want out of this bc it's not worth what comes with it.",2
"I only tried this pill for barely under 3 weeks because I couldn't take the side effects anymore! I might have been allergic to something in the pill. The final time taking it,  itched my legs for 3  straight min, causing me to break out in hives. Among the other issues I experienced on Microgestin was chest pain, body soreness, breast tenderness and moodiness. This pill was a nightmare for me. Except it caused my period to be very light, which was awesome. Switched to Tri-Sprintec and so far (1 week) it's been fine.",2
"Remeron worked great for my insomnia and also eliminated anxiety better than any other medicine I have tried.  HOWEVER, it made me hungry constantly.  The resulting weight gain resulted in diabetes and high blood pressure and exacerbated my sleep apnea. I had to stop taking it because of these adverse effects.  Unfortunately, I've not found an acceptable alternative.",2
Went to my doctor because I needed to lose 40 to 20 pounds. I have been on Contrave for three weeks and have lost six pounds. The only problem is my doc gave me Xanax as this keeps me calm as the Contrave makes me anxious.This medicine is not worth it. It makes me feel very wired. I guess I should have known when the Xanax was prescribed.,2
"Thought I was going okay. Feeling the best I had in awhile. But, what it has done now is destroy my self confidence. I have no word retrieval, memory black spots. I value my intelligence, it sometimes feels like all I have left.",2
So I've just had my IUD for about 2 weeks now. The cramping is no exaggeration. It is very painful and does feel as if it was a contraction coming on. My period has lasted now for about 12 days and doesn't seem to be subsiding. I will give this a try for 3 months and if theres no improvement will need to change to a different method. I have a 22 yr old and a 14yr old and the only good thing about the paragard is the fact that I don't have to worry for 3 yrs.,2
"I took Bactrim 2x's a day for ten days (should have been 14 days). The first ten days, no problems at all. On the night of the tenth day I itched all night and woke up with a rash all over my body. Dr. said to stop taking the Bactrim. He gave me two doses of steriods (40mg a day for 2 days) and benedryl. I quit taking the Benedryl on day 3 because the rash had cleared up. The next day it began to spread again. I have been taking Benedrly for seven days now and when I dont take it my cheeks get very &quot;rosy&quot;. I would love to know how long this stuff stays in your system. Even the mfg. says you can have a reaction up to 2 months later. Thats really scary!",2
I'm taking these pills for almost 2 months and I have spotting almost non-stop. Other than that no side effects. I will stop taking LoLo if my spotting will not stop by the end of second pack,2
"So I am giving the paraguard a 2. I had my first child almost 3 yrs ago. I got the IUD put in 3 months after delivery. It did not hurt that bad to insert just a lot of pressure and mild cramping after. The reason I chose this IUD was because I had tried several b.c pills in past and always had issues with hormones. Overall it served its purpose but I did have side effects I just felt tired all the time, anxiety, bloated and some more severe period symptoms in the beginning, I also started having a lot of chronic back and neck pain and just felt pretty shitty all the time, not healthy. I decided to take it out this past week after having it almost 3 yr. I already feel better more energy less bloat and it's crazy but my back pain Is gone!!",2
"Just took first dose.  Mixed with water and didn't breathe while drinking, so didn't taste it.  Took me 4 long drinks, separated by swigs of Zevia Lemon Twist colorless soda and 3-2 minute pauses. Chewing Double-mint gum right now - so far so good.",2
"I took two pills, as directed, in the afternoon and by the evening I had cramping. Nothing MAJOR, but enough to keep me uncomfortable. I kept feeling like I had to go to the bathroom, but couldn't. Around 8:30 pm I finally found relief with a BM. Unfortunately, it didn't end there. I have severe runs and have gone to the bathroom several more times. It feels like my stomach acid is burning my anus. I mean, it DID the job, but at what cost? My bottom is burnt. I recommend this as your absolute last resort.",2
Prozac was the first medicine I tried for anxiety. I tend to worry a lot and obsess over things. I felt a decrease in my anxiety but it made me too lazy. I didn't want to do anything except sit on the couch and watch TV. I was even too lazy to eat which caused me to lose weight. I then tried Lexapro which I gained weight on but felt a significant decrease in anxiety and now I am on Cymbalta and do not feel a significant decrease in my anxiety and am thinking about talking to my doctor about trying something new again.,2
"I was put on Sutent (32.2 mg) after chemo failed to stabilize my liver metastasis. Sutent helped to shrink the tumors but the side effects were too many. I got blisters on my hands and feet, my hair turned grey, I had diarrhea and gas all day. Overall my quality of life was severely compromised and it was even hard for me to walk. Finally they changed my medicine to Afinitor which did a good job without any side effects.",2
I have been taking these pills for a few months now.  I have been experiencing major sweating issues. I sweat through most of my clothes and experience hot flash; type feeling through out the day.  I did like that this pill has made my periods extremely light and they only last for about 2 days.  That is nice but I am not sure if I can deal with the excessive sweating.,2
"Just took this about 12 hrs ago. There was a bit of intensified burning and itching but not any worse than the discomfort the yeast infection was causing me. I iced my labia and vulva which helped a lot. Haven't seen any improvement yet, hoping to feel at least a little better tomorrow.",2
"The first month I was on the patch, I bled for the entire month and was completely miserable! My second patch also fell off 3 minutes after I put it on so I had to use my third patch and then wear it for 8 days because I had to get my next prescription a week early. The next month, my period was lighter but I got it twice, both shorter than my usual 8 day cycle. This third month, I've had unbelievable cramps that no medicine will relieve and incredible nausea. On the bright side, I'm not pregnant, though I'm not sexual active, and my acne has cleared up a lot. Not sure if it's worth it though.",2
I was on it for 3 months when I stopped because it was $328 a month even with my insurance(I have a high deductible plan) after about a month being off I asked my dr for something else. He told me no because it took us so long to find that. He provided me for samples for the next 2 months. It was like a magic pill for me as far as my depression it even helped my anxiety to the point where I wasn't taking Xanax anymore. But it defiantly lowered my sex drive which has almost cost me my marriage. I also gained a total of 22lbs. After being on the medicine for about 2 months it seemed that it just stopped working. The depression is back and one some days worse than before and the anxiety has been so severe I had to go to the ER one night.,2
"I am currently on day 2 of macrobid, 2x daily for 2 days. Pharmacist was sure to emphasize to take macrobid with food to prevent nausea. So far, I have no nausea, but have developed a terrible headache. I must say, that pain of the UTI was gone within two hours of taking my first dose, which is worth it to me. So I'll be sticking this one out and hope the headache doesn't worsen.",2
"Well, I've been on the 2g daily tube of Testim for a week now, and I'm beginning to wonder when/if I'll see an impact. The Doctor didn't share my T number, except to comment that it was low. The pharmacist didn't have a lot of instruction on how to use it, except to rub it into my forearm...WRONG: Shoulders, according to a DVD mini disk that I found...very helpful.  I'm not sure what the value of washing off the gel or showering after two hours is. I DO smell it initially, and have read all the warnings to keep it off others, women, kids, towels, etc... but why would I want to wash off the medicine?  It may just be my imagination, but I find I am thinking of sex more (fantasizing) but have not touched my wife since starting this yet.",2
I hope this gets posted. Norforms vaginal suppositories have cured my recurrent BV !!! I used them every other day for a month and I finally have my normal vagina back !!!,2
I have been on and off of this medication since Feb 08. My skin infection keeps coming back.,2
"I started this pill when I first had my son. It was great at first and I experienced zero side effects. Then everything hit at once. My periods are almost constant, I've gained a crazy amount of weight even though I do heavy cardio 4 times a week and eat a healthy, vegan diet. I really liked this pill but it's inconvenient for long term use. I really can't wait to discontinue using it.",2
"I took this BC for 4 months.  The first month was great.  My skin cleared up, I had no weight gain or other side effects.  By the end of the second month however I felt anxious and irritable.  My breasts were painfully tender and I had alot of discharge.  I stopped taking it by the end of the fourth month.",2
I've been taking the generic for 3 months. Glad to see other posters talking about the groggyness and sedated feeling the next day after taking it at night.  Just a few breakouts that are gone by morning along with my energy.  The one thing is I take it at night and can't sleep for about 2-4 hours after taking it.  ,2
"I was put on Lyrica by my anesthetist for post operative pain control following a revision of a Dupuy metal on metal hip.  Has certainly helped the pain in this and the other hip and reduced the muscle spasms I was experiencing.  However side effects have increased with use and I have severe visual disturbance, foggy mind and forgetfulness.  I was on 120mg 3 times a day and tried to stop.  Big mistake severe cold turkey with shaking nausea and panic attacks.  Now trying to come off slowly but really struggling with the side effects.",2
Do not drink alcohol when taking this medicine!,2
"So I got the implant in July of 2012. At first I was feeling okay, but after a couple weeks I think I became depressed. I get very moody and very impatient really fast. I don't get as happy as much anymore. I get periods, but they are very light and once a month 4/2 days. I've gained at least six of seven pound from the implant. I also got weird discharge at first I talked to my gyno about it and she said it was perfectly normal with the implant to have darker discharge. The implant works very well. I think I will probably keep the implant in for a couple more months to see if the side effects get better or go away.",2
"i've been on nexplanon for 8 months now, and i really don't care for it. it's made me gain 20 pounds. at first it didn't make me want to eat at all. also the first month i had a period for 3 weeks and i haven't had a period since which is nice but it just doesn't seem normal to me. sometimes it pinches me sometimes n hurts my arm. i personally would rather be back on the pill. going to get it removed soon.",2

32. Depression on and off since 12yrs old. Tried diff Meds. On Welbutrin for 2 years and felt like it stopped working. About Aug 2012 I was crying constantly so switched to Prisitiq 20mg began Dec'12 and crying stopped. But so did all of my other feelings. I Feel nothing.  Plus zero libido. zero. That is not good for a marriage. Thankfully hubby supportive.  Quit taking Dec 30 Dr warned me cold turkey would not good but trying. Feelings coming back but too bad just sadness right now.  Wish I never even tried this. Tears are better than no feelings.,2
"Abilify helped me at the maxed out dose of 30mg. I noticed that it made my manic episodes be more contained, however, when I was depressed it dragged me down deeper. I actually was suicidal. It was a real painful thing since usually my manic episodes are a lot worse.",2
Norco just made me woozy and did not really help with the pain of my broken ribs. ,2
I love how easy it is but in 9 months I have gained 20 pounds and am getting really sad. I don't have any bleeding at all but I worry about the side effects on my weight and attitude.,2
"I would NOT recommend taking this medication for longer than a few weeks for insomnia. It works amazingly well at first, but then, over the course of time, you will need to up the dosage to get the same result. Over time, you will find that the medication makes you groggy and can cause weight gain. Then, when you try to get off, it is very, very hard. I was only on 20mgs for 2 months, and it has taken 2 months for my sleep to occur naturally more than in 2 hour increments. Overall it made my insomnia worse.",2
I've been taking Apri for 2 months now in hopes to clear my acne. There has been zero improvement! Although everything else about Apri is positive. No weight gain,2
"I use Alesse for my acne, I didn't have that bad acne but I started 3 months ago and my acne got worse since then and won't totally clear up. Some days my face is not that bad and sometimes it's bad and it bothers me since before taking this pill my acne was controllable. I think this product is not that helpful for acne, well that's just for me but I don't know about others, everyone is different and has different skin.",2
Not able to determine true effectiveness because within a week of starting it caused severe nose bleeds so had to discontinue use. ,2
well I got my implant about a year ago it was bad at first my period was ongoing for about 2 months then it stopped then I just recently started to have my period every week it will only stop for 2 days then go again. I have been reading and it turns out this implant can cause you to be sterile for the rest of your life. I have been wanting to take it out but I can't I mean I do want to have kids some day. Now doctors are recommending for there patients not to have this implant because it has been causing a lot of women to not be able to have any kids even after a long time without the implant in. Don't get me wrong its amazing but if you ever want kids just take the pill.,2
"Very easy to take a pill form medicine vs injection. I experienced very low white blood cells with terrible headaches, body aches, tiredness and nausea after taking the medicine for 4 months. I am slowly feeling better after just two weeks without any medication; I have an appointment with Dr. next week.",2
"I started taking Arimidex about 4 - 2 months ago as a breast cancer patient.  I'm supposed to take it for 2 years.  The side-effects I've experienced are: insomnia, hot flashes, headaches, weight gain, joint pain, and severe loss of grip in both hands. My hands are stiff in the morning and evening, it's just crazy.  Well, even throughout the day.  I asked my oncologist about this and he said it was arthritis, which I do NOT believe.  The onset was too quick.  It was about 2 weeks after I started taking the Arimidex then the hand stiffness showed up. ",2
I might have taken to much but  it gave me symptoms of a stroke after 2 hours  in the ER they said my levels of T4 were really high I think it was 2  as  I had been on the 90 mg day from 30mg so maybe I went up too fast,2
"I been taken Actos 30mg since a year from now and my sugar lever went down but not enough, then my doctor changed it to 42mg. Is great for my sugar level but my legs, feet and ankle can not handle it ss too much swelling.",2
I find it hard to say if it has really helped my pain and find that my anxiety level has increased as well as having suicidal thoughts.  ,2
My doctor had switched me to to Trinessa (as it was completely covered by my insurance) about 2 years ago. It cleaned up my acne gave me soft beautiful skin. Light periods. And my cramps went away. But about 2 month ago I noticed I was getting pimples at the time of my period. No big deal because the went away at the end of my period. However the last couple of months I've had really bad breakouts on my chin and they are not going away! I guess every good thing comes to an end,2
"After having my IUD removed, I decided to go with a short term birth control so I could try for a baby within the next couple years.  It got put in in October 2012. By mid December I was having unexplained bruising on my legs, symptoms of bronchitis/asthma, weakness, and coughing up blood. In February 2012 I was finally diagnosed with Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli and congestive heart failure and was hospitalized for a week. I was referred to a hematologist to figure out why I got the clots, being that blood disorders or heart disease does not run in my family.  The Dr finally concluded that it was due to the new birth control I had so it was taken out by March of 2012. I guess I was the unlucky 1 in 30,000 to have severe side effects.",2
"So...I had my 2nd baby and followed my same routine as before...had my 2 week check up, got on the mini pill b/c I am breastfeeding...then start having sex and going to the gym again...YAY!!!

I have an appointment to meet with my doctor to discuss taking other pills or the Depo shot. I have since lost all the rapid weight I gained.",2
"The first dose I used of this Monistat cream applicator, was one of the uncomfortable and painful experiences of my vaginas life. I had used the ovule before and had experienced NO discomfort. The cream applicator was the total opposite. After inserting the cream, 2/3min went by until the severe burning kicked in. It last at least 30 minutes.  The only thing that kept me from crying was reading everyone else's similar experience. Thank God for you other women who shared your same stories! I am currently on my 2nd dose and it is so much less painful. If the first dose was a 3 in pain, the second was a 2 for me. It seems like it's working! So hopefully the pain was worth it!",2

"Really good experience with stronger dose. Now on lower dose and after a year or so the effect is nothing like as good. As atrophic vaginal conditions increase with age, it is obvious that what once worked well will no longer be effective at lower dosage. It is a shame that so many women will have to suffer this painful condition because of a shiort term study of a very small sample of women.",2
"Have had nexplanon in my arm for a little over a year now. No problems with the insertion. It is very effective. Didn't use a condom. Sex at least once a week and haven't gotten pregnant yet so thats why I give it a five star rating. Side effects for me were slim in the first couple of months but soon after my mood definitely changed. I cry over everything now. I've experienced mood swings, appetite increase and decrease, some days I can't stop ranting.  I have gone from occasional depression to depressed all of the time. Can't sleep.  Anxiety all day long. Dizzy. Fatigue all day. Longer periods. Never had anxiety attacks before, do now. They're becoming more frequent. Getting it removed",2
"I just started taking these pills about a month ago, I'm about to start my second pack. The only side effects I've had is slight nausea the first week I started taking them. My breasts are swollen, I still break out, and have had a lot of spotting initially but now I don't. I don't have any mood swings. I feel sleepy even though I sleep plenty. That's about it.",2
"I was using the birth control ring for 2+ years.  In May, 2012 I switched to the Ortho Evra patch. I was given the Xulane birth control patch, the generic form of Ortho Evra. I've not had a single problem. . .  UNTIL NOW!  The first week of March I put a new patch on my lower abdomen. Within 2-8 hours I had a raised, burning, itchy rash under the patch.  I'd never had this problem before no matter where I place the patch. I removed that patch and put a new patch on my upper shoulder. Within 2 hours another raised, itchy burning rash under the patch. I removed that patch. Now I have two square raised, red, burning, itchy rash spots!!  Needless to say I have to stop Xulane. Not sure what to use now.",2
"My teenaged son is congested from February through June. We live in the part of Texas where you can actually watch the cedar pollen pods explode (literally). I was so excited to hear all the promises of Dymista, but every squirt caused him to have crazy sneezing fits - like 12-20 in a row! We kept trying for 3 days, but he was miserable with the sneezing. Haven't seen any other reviews mention this, so I guess we are just special ",2
Was prescribed cipro 2x/day with Flagyl 3x/day and they seemed to work although not as quickly as other reviewers.  Not sure if it was the cipro alone or the combination but nausea was the main symptom.  I would be fine for a few hours after the Flagyl but within an hour of taking the cipro I would have to lay down due to nausea and exhaustion.  Still taking it and counting the days.  Hopefully will not have an occasion to use this again.,2

"i have tooken 30mg a day for almost a year now , i was suposed to do it only 3month but when i stopped it came back so my dermatologist kept prescribed it to me .. it worked good for about 2month and now it looks like its all starting again ... the pills dont work for me anymore",2
"There were many positives to Alesse (I was on the generic - Aviane). This was about my 4th or 2th kind of BC pill, as I tend to have issues and side effects with most others. The only side effects I had on this were spotty, random periods, and acne. I can handle the breakthrough bleeding, but the acne was just awful. I have acne prone skin, and Yaz totally cleared it up, but made me gain weight. When I switched to Alesse, I lost weight (not entirely due to changing the pill) but my acne came back horribly. I am going to switch soon. I didn't have any mood swings. I have some cramps during my period. It didn't mess with my sex drive (Yaz killed it). I would recommend this ONLY if you don't have issues with acne.",2
I recently went to the doctor to have a physical because I'm turning 20 this year. Well everything was a okay except for the thyroid numbers were wrong. So she suggested that I take this medicine. Its only been 2 days so have to see yet. I'm a little under normal weight and its hard to keep it on. I eat a lot but that doesn't work so I'm hoping this will.,2
I started Phentermine a week ago tomorrow and have only lost 1 lb.  I am reading all these stories and getting a little worried. Did it take a few weeks to start working for anyone else. I do notice I am not as hungry and have cotton-mouth all the time. I go to the doctor tomorrow. Update will follow.,2
The medication itself works which is the only positive thing I can say.   This &quot;needleless&quot; injection is so much more painful than any needle I've ever experienced.  I'll be going back to real injections.  My leg is still throbbing in pain 30 minutes later and it took over 2 minutes to stop the bleeding!   I've never had pain or bleeding with an Imitrex shot through a hypodermic needle.  Who would choose this?,2
I have only been taking this medicine for 2 days and all I have been having is cramps. I have never had any problems with any other birth control. This is the only side effect I have had after only 2 days of starting it.,2
I have been taking generic Adipex since Dec. 2012. I am 2 food tall and was 211 pounds. The first 11 pounds came off quick. Then I got down to 192. Now I am back up to 200 and can't drop the weight. My energy level is a lot better though. I don't really eat that much. So maybe my body is holding on to what I do eat. Who knows.,2
"I am 12 years old and started this birth control a month ago. Got pretty bad nausea and headaches the first couple weeks but it went away. I don't take the placebo pills for my period week because they make my period worse and going off the placebo seems to help. I started my second pack yesterday and took a double dose because I skipped a day. Woke up this morning, vomited profusely all day. If it gets worse, I'm going to the hospital.",2
"I am on the fourth week of Vienva and have experienced nausea, headaches, mood swings, spotting and bloating! Hopefully these symptoms pass after three months like they say! I hate birth control to begin with because of all the symptoms and I always experience all of them but what are we supposed to do? ",2
"I have been taking Chantix for 4 days now and it works great for quitting smoking, but the side effects are harsh. I get so sick on it and also I get so angry for no reason. I am yelling at everyone.  I have also been having problems with the depression.  If you have any of these problems then you should see your doctor.",2
Side effect was mild direahea and bloody stool.,2
"I began taking Tri- Nessa to clear up my skin. I have never had perfectly clear skin, but before and during my period my skin ( including back and shoulders) would break out horribly. After only a week of the pill, I noticed my skin was very clear. I have never had such amazing skin! During my period I still get a few zits, but not bad enough to wear makeup. My period never starts until the 2th placebo,and has always been short, but I no longer cramp! My mood is stable, and I have gone up a cup size. I am stopping the pill due to a 3 pound, in three month, weight gain. I'm a runner, and have always been able to maintain my weight.  I intake 2000 calories, burn a 2400/day and went from 120 to 131 in 3 months.",2
"Lowers cholestorol but I have the oddest side effect - I call it itchy feet. In the bottoms only and nothing stops the itchy feeling, except Neurontin. It's an internal nerve itch, not external. I was scratching on concrete, anything to make it stop.",2
"I was very nauseous and vomited and felt like I had the flu throughout the therapy. I was warned that I might get diarrhea but fortunately I didn't. I got a second endoscopy done and a biopsy to see if the medicine worked, and...it was unsuccessful.",2
"When I took Accutane, my acne did clear up after a couple of months. But the side effects were very annoying, including excessively dry face and lips and back pain. It actually came to a point that I couldn't continue dancing because of this back pain. I was glad to be finished with it after the allotted time I was prescribed, but then 2 months later my acne came back in full. My doctor said this is normal and usually goes away within weeks, but mine didn't. I'm still struggling with acne despite having taken Accutane.",2
"I've had  really bad headache for over 2 weeks now. On my right side.   I say &quot;a&quot; because it is almost constant, day and night every day.  Seldom have I had headaches my entire life.  I'm now 20.  After 4 visits to a doctor, (the first one prescribed antibiotics saying I had a sinus infection-no help what so ever, the second guy Midrin, same thing). I was prescribed nortriptyline at 22mg once a day by my last visit with a new doctor.  It has been 3 days, so not much change, yet.  I can put up with any/all the side effects mentioned, if I get relief.  I will repost in a week or 2, when hopefully it has kicked in.  Scheduled for a CAT scan in 2 days.....we'll see.  Reading these posts has given me some hope.",2
40yr old female!  I have Hoshi thyroid disorder. Had a hysterectomy in my mid 20s which is the cause of my osteoporosis.  I have been on this going on my 4th month so far no side effects.  Small bruising at injection site. I'll have a new scan in about 2 months I feel very hopeful for improved results.,2
Started ambein. Took for years. I built a tolorence.  Now on lunesta at 3mg. Worked for about a month and now I am back to sleepless nights :(,2
"I have MS GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) and GASTROPARESIS and have been taking Metoclopramide 2 mg , 2/ a day for a year then they raised it to 2mg/4 times a day. Soon after they went up 3mg 4/ times a day. When i went to the 4 a day i started having problems. It started with a low grade fever and major confusion and then came the breathing troubles, plus some anxiety that got pretty bad. I could not catch my breath mainly at night. It got so bad I was even starting to panic. It may have caused other side effects but with MS they were hard to tell. I just stopped taking them and after the second night my breathing was a little better.I am hoping that goes away. ",2
"Man. It hasn't been a month &amp; my body is all out of wack. Mood swings, lack of sex drive, extreme hunger within minutes of taking the pill, headaches, dry mouth and vagina! ",2
"I've been on Lexapro for two days with Ativan for emergencies. I'm very pleased with Lexapro for being just a few days and already seeing a difference, plus medicine usually makes me very sick and this did not. Its nice to go to bed and not have 2 or 3 panic attacks with over thinking and palpitations. My only dislike, so far, is that it makes my teeth feel very strange and it's a little annoying. And also since it makes me tired, I take it before bed. But if I miss that window of being severely tired and don't fall asleep, then I am up for hours and hours. Still very tired, but restless. I hope to see those side effects go away after a long period of taking them.",2
"I'm currently 21 yrs old and have had Skyla for a little over a year now. The insertion was unpleasant and painful.The cramps I experienced after were the worst cramps I have ever felt before. Please take a pain killer immediately if you feel any cramping. Every time I experience the cramping it makes me want to vomit and cry. I have never cramped this bad before having Skyla. I believe this has helped with my acne but I still breakout majorly when it's that time. When that time comes around I experience the same painful cramping but only for a couple days. Another down side is my period lasts for about 2 weeks! There are no signs of my period decreasing or stopping even after a year of insertion.Overall, I regret the Skyla.",2
I'm writing my experience due to the fact when I was researching skyla I couldn't find very many reviews....my experience wasn't horrible yet wasn't the best I decided to get skyla in Oct of 2014 it was newly out I decided on it rather then mirena since skyla was lower dosed and smaller I haven't had any kids initially the insertion did hurt but wouldn't say excruciating Dr wrote for a valium before hand so that helped I'm sure after insertion felt fine went to work didn't have any crazy cramps or bleeding all was good up until about 4 months in I started getting crazy cystic acne on my face and back never had acne before and started getting really bad sharp pains here and there so I waited skyla out for about 2 months then had it removed,2
"I got 2mg samples from my doctor for depression and anxiety and took almost the whole sample bottle but had to stop. This drug affected me very oddly and I couldnt take it anymore. In the beginning I felt like I was on speed, which I didnt mind. It got rid of my depression and anxiety almost immediately. My confidence came back and I could get up in the morning. Towards the end, however, I had increased cravings for food, I went from not being able to sleep at all to having to sleep ALL DAY. My nipples almost got really tender and a little swollen. I knew I had to get off this medication it was horrible. Hopefully Wellbutrin will work for me.",2
"I'm 12 years old and I have taken a wide variety of antidepressants. I find Lexapro to be one of the better ones. I take 3mg of Lexapro and it does alright. I have noticed a 3  Pound weight gain on about 1 1/2 months of taking this. From my experiences with antidepressants, I do not like them. This is my 4th antidepressant and I just can't find the right one.",2
"My doctor started me on Microgestin over a year ago to control my endometriosis symptoms. So far, it has helped completely with the irregular bleeding I was experiencing. I still have pain, so it hasn't 30% helped with that aspect. One side effect that almost made me stop altogether was the breast tenderness. I do notice that I get a small amount of acne at times. I have suffered with migraines for 12 years and I honestly feel that this  medicine brings them on or makes them worse. I have recorded 21 migraines in less than a year so am currently considering switching to another method of birth control.",2
"I'm not sure why so many people like this drug for insomnia. First night took 20mg  slept for 2 hours. Second night took 30mg slept for 2 hours. Third night took 120mg &amp; slept for 2 hours. So I thought everything was cool at 120mg, but after 1 week it started to become less effective was only getting 4 hours of sleep on 120mg. I would even try to split the dose (take 20mg an hour before bedtime  30mg at bedtime) but nothing gave. I think Zyprexa works better, but got on this because zyprexa makes you gain weight on ANY dose, while seroquel's weight gain is more dose related (supposedly). Stopped taking it since it sucks at KEEPING me asleep (though it is good at putting me to sleep).",2
"I had this inserted February 2013 after my Implanon was due for removal (I didn't have a period with Implanon for 3 years and was really pleased). The insertion was fine but within about 2-3 weeks I had my period for at least a month. It's now Sept 2012 and I have my period for literally 3 weeks of the month every month, this can reach to 4 weeks now and again. If I have a 4 week period I won't have another one for sometimes 1 week or 4 weeks and it's the same on and on. This month has been dreadful, I have been depressed, stressed, crying, bleeding for 3 weeks now and I feel dizzy nearly every day. My period was ending and started again as it was ending. It's absolute torture. So I'm getting it out on Tuesday, can't handle it anymore!",2
"I've had ParaGard since March of 2012 (it's now May 2012) and am looking to have it removed. Pros: It's hormone free (huge plus if you're a breastfeeding mom and dont want your milk supply to decrease). And the insertion process wasnt so bad. Some cramping afterwards and bleeding for quite a few days after. Cons: I constantly have discharge and have to wear pantiliners on a regular basis. And I'm not talking light discharge. It's thick, gooey and muscousy. I have gone to 2 different OBGYNs regarding this (to make sure I didnt have an infection) &amp; both said it's a normal side effect. It seriously grosses me out &amp; this is the main reason I am getting it taken out. My periods are also heavy and last 2-3 days. Its awful! Time for a new BC.",2
"When I first started taking Beyaz it was great. I had no problems but towards the end of the cycle I had terrible attitude, was very emotional, nauseous and too many headaches. Once my period was gone it came back a day after and it was light to medium. Very bad cramps. My appetite increased a lot more when I started. But everyone's body is different and would react different to the pills.",2
"This mediicne was given to me as I was being taken off an antidepressant and has given me headaches, nausea, joint pain, and feeling of not being fully alert.  I was started at a 1200mg daily dose and I think that is way too high for me.  I have been at this dose for over three months and the doctors seem to think that the side effects are outweighed by the positives.  I have felt more depressed since they put me on this but they worry about that it. I would rather have the antidepressants back at least, I could be a human with them.",2
I was on this pill for 4 months and half. I didn't finish the last month because I COULD NOT stand the way I was feeling anymore. I had constant mood swings and was irritated basically all the time. My acne got worse even after having been on the pill for 4 months already. I switched now to a progesterine-only pill because I was having terrible migraines as well.,2
"I've been taking 220mg for almost a week.  At first I felt a bit euphoric, but that quickly passed.  Now I just feel physically anxious- sweating, increased heart rate and blood pressure, heat waves.  I'm cutting down to 120mg and hoping that the effects subside as I get used to being on the medicine.  If this anxiety does not go away, I cannot continue on the medication.",2
I didn't use it long enough to see if it would prevent my monthly migraine but I wanted to share the side effects I experienced.  I started with 22 milligrams twice a day for 2 days and felt ok but did experience some tingling in my feet and fingers.  Then I increased to 20 milligrams twice a day per doctor's order and things really changed.  I started having the craziest dreams every night.  Tingling was very pronounced every day in feet and hands.  I couldn't get out of bed easily. I felt very lethargic and really like a zombie. I kind of had a flat affect and felt very robotic at times. Other times I was very depressed and irritable or even angry.  I stopped taking it. Also was hungry all the time. That was not normal for me at all.,2
I just got mine in a month ago and I feel and look really bloated all the time. I've been on my period for almost 2 weeks I don't like it so I'm getting it removed tomorrow.,2
"My 2 yr old daughter just started taking Vyvnase 40mg in the morning after 2 yrs of avoiding medications, she has completely slowed down and is able to focus. My only concern is her having dry mouth and biting on the inside of her jaw, this is her first day hopefully it just needs a few days to adjust. BIG difference already. I hope this is all we need and it continues to get better.",2
"This is my 2th month on Gildess (my first form of birth control taken). I'm really confused with how my body is reacting to it. It made my vagina weirdly dry, mood swings were present before but were somehow amplified, and I bleed even when I'm not on my period (not just spotting, like a solid week before my period week). I'm trying out Gildess Fe 1.2/30 to see if it was a dosage problem, but it might be the brand itself. Wish me luck and good luck to all who try it!",2
"My 2 yo was on Abilify for two months.  His temper tantrums and ability to concentrate were greatly improved, however, the gained 20 pounds and the doctor took him off it.  He was also very weepy and emotional on it.",2
"I was initially scared to go on Zoloft, as I had been on it when I was 12 for depression and I was told I was a despondent zombie. I'm 18 now and have probably taken 3 different antidepressants. Two months ago I began having horrible intrusive thoughts, and this was the first drug recommended. I agreed to try it after some pushing from my doctor and more experimentation. The first two weeks was hell; I couldn't keep anything down. I lost 18 pounds in two weeks. My OCD is better but it's still not great. I had periods of derealization when switching doses and some of it has stayed. I'm currently on 30mg and probably going to up my dose.",2
"I took it for three 1/2 weeks it gives some pain relief. 200 MG per day. I prefer the hydrocodon. It made me very tired after 2 8 hours, and effected my vision some when reading close. Probably good for some if you don't travel much and can just stay home.",2
"I am still a little scared of this medicine. I started with the Green starter pack and smoked all the way through it, even though I didn't need to - almost as a way to test the drug and say goodbye to my best friend/worst enemy. On day 8, no more smoking. I'm on my third pack. I notice I sleep more than I did during the 18 years I have smoked 1.2-2 packs a day. I don't have a reason to get up so early before work anymore. Funny how we adjust our lives and compromise our health and ignore our symptoms to fit/keep our habit. No wild dreams so far, but I definitely have a increased emotional response - either way, anger or tears. So far so good.",2
I was given samples if dexilant from my Dr.  I was recently diagnosed with GERD. I had mucus in the back of my throat so bad I couldn't eat anything at all. I could hardly drink water without it irritating the acid in my throat. The dexilant worked like a charm I could eat and I had no side effects. Then after a week of use I started getting bad cramps in my legs.  They just recently spread to my entire body. I went to the er yesterday morning they told me I had tardiv dyskonesia. I stopped taking all my medications a week ago and the cramps are still here they Here.!!  I was given benadryl in the er and was told to continue use for 3days to see if the reaction goes away...  I'd rather have the diarrhea then constant muscle spasms,2
"I gave it a 2 because Im only on day 2 of treatment. The only reason I'm leaving a review is because the side effects have been awful already. I've vomited every single day between last Wednesday (first dose) and today (Monday, 2th dose). I've had a killer headache 3 out of 2 days. I can't sleep for longer than a couple of hours, which makes no sense as I'm on 2 different sedatives - I should definitely be sleeping. And i've been constantly covered in sweat. Even when I feel cold, I'm sweating like an animal. I haven't noticed any mood changes (positive or negative) which is expected because of the short time I've been taking it. I just thought I'd share the side effects and hope they go away with continued treatment!",2
"For me the medication worked fine as far as reducing the inflammation. My inflammation was in one of my eyes and it did relieve the inflammation but the side effects, wow. I have been drowsy off and on and had terrible stomach pains. For me I added this to my do not take list but for someone who is not taking it everyday probably would not have as much stomach upset. I took it every day for almost two weeks. Too long for something that is hard on someone's stomach.",2
"I am having nightmares, hallucinations, swollen ankles, legs with spots, falling down, sudden sleep, itchy skin,  Also, shock at the fact that the cost went from $2 per 90 tabs to $249 for 180 in just 18 months.  Will not continue due to cost.  This is what I pay after Humana says they pay.  ",2
"I'm 22 and have had weak flow for years.  It seems I've tried every drug available, but not much relief.  First dose of Rapaflo gave noticeable improvement within hours.  I thought I had found the solution until the diarrhea started.  Cut the dose to the 4mg capsule once per day and diarrhea solved, but sexual problems set in.  No ejaculation.  Judging from this site this is not a minor side effect, but almost a guarantee.  After a few weeks I began to have increasing difficulty reaching orgasm at all.  My sex life is fading fast.  Rated +3 for effectiveness and 0 for side effects.",2
My son is 8 yrs old and could not hold anything down. The doctor gave him Zofran and he began to have hallucination! Well come to find out he is the 22 reported case in the U.S. He had to be sent to a children's hospital. My daughter is 2 and had Zofran she did really well. She did a complete 320 in minutes. Just goes to show how everybody is different.,2
"I first was inflicted with Herpes Simplex in my right eye over 32 year ago. Treatment then consisted of getting rid of the virus including steroids and then weening off all meds. Much similar now but Dr. prescribed Acyclovir to protect against the re-occurance. Ever since I started taking the drug, my eye socket aches, my eye waters and is red, plus I get occasional  hot flash. My Dr has cut my dose in half from 400ml to 200 ml. but i still have the symptoms. I will go back and request an alternative medication.",2
Love the medication itself BUT the plastic is too hard to satisfactorily press to get two or even sometimes one drop to release. I hope they address this immediately because the cost of the medication Vs the questionable ability to apply is making me rethink using it.,2
"I started taking this medication about 3 years ago for Depression/Social Anxiety. I will say for depression this drug worked wonders, not so much anxiety though. However, recently I've decided to try for the 3rd time to stop taking it. The withdrawal you get from Effexor is the worst feeling.",2
"My doctor put me on Keppra to see if it will help with my problems of completing sentences and being at a loss of words. I haven't been on the medicine long, but the side effects are very apparent. I feel almost drunk sometimes I am nauseous and dizzy and have not noticed any change in my condition. I have to be very aware and on top of my game to do my job.",2
I was diagnosed 14 yrs ago with Fibromyalgia. My doctor prescribed Elavil.3 mg. per day. It helped me sleep better but heart began beating to fast and was discontinued. Helped a little with pain.,2
"Very painful muscle and joint problems from this medication.  Searing pain in elbows, wrists, knees, etc. Never had this before taking this medication. My  husband is also on this pill and is experiencing some of the same problems.",2
"Got the typical starter pack. One week at 3mg - noticeable antidepressant effect, side effects of diarrhea and weird dreams. One week at  20 mg -  suddenly had tons of energy. Found myself getting lots of housework done, starting up projects I had been putting off for months, but no true enjoyment of things I loved. Diarrhea remained, some insomnia started. 2 weeks at  40 mg - Energy remained good at first, wasn't depressed but wasn't happy either. Just became numb like  with all other SSRI's I've tried. Diarrhea persisted. Had trouble getting up each morning and felt foggy all day but still had energy to get things done. NO libido. Anhedonia persisted. Not the right drug for me.",2
"I've had skyla for almost two years and I'm very iffy on how I feel towards it. The insertion wasn't bad, just a big cramp. My period used to be only a few days, very heavy, and I never had cramps. With skyla I have light spotting that lasts twice as long with some pretty TERRIBLE cramps and nausea. The week before I get the spotting I have extreme cravings and gain like five pounds and then lose it all right away from barely eating the week I spot. I used to struggle with acne and now my skin is always clear. My spouse is sometimes jabbed by the strings. I didn't want something with a lot of hormones so I chose skyla over other forms of birth control, but I feel like the cons may outweigh the pros for me.",2
After 3 years on naprosyn 200 one a day I started to get irritable anxious finding fault all the time about stupid things. As soon as I stopped I was normal again .  I don't know what tablet to take now as I am very sensitive to a lot of drugs.,2
Well its only my second month almost third and my experience has been very well until I randomly got my period and since then have been spotting since then. I get cramps randomly in class and have discharge in my underwear. I don't recommend this pill. I think its awful,2
Worked for about a month then I started sleeping 13-12 hours a night and lost all motivation.,2
"I have always had a problem with focus and attention and recently was told I have ADHD, I am currently on Vyvanse and when I started it, I found the first few days to be great. I almost felt superhuman with myself because I was able to start and finish things in one go and felt more active. I have had to have my dosage increased and I feel that as I take this medication, the effectiveness of it is dissipating and being replaced with a feeling of being &quot;Frantic&quot; and sightly anxious as well as it is affecting my mood and causing me to feel adgitated. I will be asking my doctor about trying something else as I feel that just increasing the dosage again would cause the feelings I am getting to becoming worse",2
"I had the implant inserted June 2012 for 3 weeks my arm had a bruise and my arm was in pain. For 2 months I had non stop spotting! Too embarrassed to have sex cause of the spotting. The first month I experienced mood swings, depression, hair loss and, migraines by the third month I still experienced all side effects except the spotting stopped. I had it removed yesterday, I just couldn't handle all those side effects any longer",2
"I got this in 8 weeks after I had my baby, and I didn't have a period for a few weeks, and now I've been on my period for almost 4 months. NON STOP. It hasn't gotten lighter, and it's not spotting. It has made me super moody, and it started to make me gain weight but I got back on my ADD meds so it evened each other out. The only reason I'm still on this is because I wouldn't remember a pill. Oh, and I've never had any bladder infections until I had this. I had one almost every month since I've had this.",2
"I do not have sensitive skin. The first time I tried using this product, it drys up my face causing redness and flaky. Now it's hurts so much I have to discontinue this product. My face is so dry and red now.",2
"I have had Mirena in for a little over 2 months. I love it for the fact I have not had a period for the entire time, just a little spotting for about 3 weeks after insertion. But I cramp pretty often still, but at my checkup the doctor told me if I could just make it through the first 2 months I would be good to go. But I'm still hurting pretty bad. I hate to keep taking medicine because I know it's not good for my body. I am tired of cramping all the time, because at times it's so bad I feel like curling up in a ball and sleeping all day. ",2
"Hi, I am 21 with a two year old. My first bc was the mirena, I had that for a year and had to get off due to having so much pain. after that was removed I got the nexplanon. I had that for 2 months and bled EVERY day. I got that removed on 2/12/12 and right after taking it out I got the skyla put in. it was uncomfortable, but really just a pressured cramp. I had cramps that night but the following day I felt fine and had unprotected sex (24 hrs after getting skyla), no pain at all. I am on day 4 of having skyla and have been cramping all day. it is different for everyone, but only you know your body and what you can and cant handle.",2
"This did the job in removing nerve pain (20mg) BUT I couldn't sleep because I was hyper. Wild dreams, sweats, and constantly waking. Being hyper was super in the day as it completely removed my severe fatigue. Dropped to half dose 22mg to see if it helped. The hyperness continued unfortunately though less, but the nerve pain also returned, though not as severe. Other side effects which are a little worrying: Woke one morning with massive pain in one eye/side of head unlike anything I've had before. Scary. Also a constant eye tic has developed plus a constant weird dizzy ringing feeling in the head and vertigo when standing. I'm thinking of stopping though love the extra energy and effect on nerve pain.",2
"When I first started taking this birth control, it was great. My periods stopped and I only had some spotting the first month or so. About two-three months in though, I felt like it made me lose my sex drive a lot and had no libido. On top of this, I noticed I had a lot of vaginal dryness - even before having sex - and this made doing anything sexual not that pleasurable. I also gained a few pounds after beginning the pill. I didn't experience any change in my acne though, as it is a possible side effect of this particular birth control.",2
"Doctor Prescribed this to me after I was diagnosed with IBS. It seemed to work, but I didn't believe I was getting full effect. The doctor said at my young age of 12 (I'm now 18 since August 2012) I should not take as high as a dosage as some people but my pain I had told them I needed more so I moved from 3mg to 20mg. I often get very thirsty as a side affect and I'm almost always constipated. I'm actually typing this up as I'm in the bathroom right now, constipated. I don't believe I should be taking other medicines like laxatives or probiotics just to make up for this medicine that should be helping me.",2
"Slight improvement in mood, yet still witness episodes of bipolarity/depression, sometimes lasting more than 24 hrs in duration (previously these episodes could last a week or more) not so down and out all the time, negative effect on sexual 'drive', no real urge to even engage with the opposite sex, let alone participate in sexual activity",2
"I am in my twenties and am currently battling my second yeast infection. For my first one, I used the Monistat 1 ovule with great success. Immediate relief of symptoms, and full treatment overnight. So, when I got my second yeast infection I used the same treatment. Immediately after inserting the ovule and using the cream, I felt the irritation and itching begin to intensify. Less than 30 minutes later I was sitting in the bathtub bawling and feeling like I could pull my hair out. I'm typically very tolerant to pain and have never had any type of reaction to ANY kind of medication. Next time, I will DEFINITELY be calling my doctor for the oral pill. The pain is not worth the money you might save. Rated 2 because it DOES work, but it hurts.",2
"After reading other reviews, I can't believe I haven't switched my birth control method. I have the same symptoms as follow (weight gain, so moody, I have never been so moody, increase vaginal discharge, constant headache, my fiance and I definitely feel the ring during intercourse). On the other hand, pros for the Nuvaring are (lighter and shorter periods, choosing when I start).",2
"While Cipro may clear up my UTI it triggered my seizure potential and lowered my seizure threshold. It also can interfere with seizure meds which isn't cool for me as it can cause seizures in people with previous head trauma too. Lastly, if also taken with NSAIDS like ibuprofen or aspirin it can raise risk. Use extreme caution if have history of seizures!!!!",2
"Side effect, swollen ankles.",2
"Six weeks since first injections in both knees. Have arthritis and tore the meniscus in both knees last Fall. Right knee is 90% bone on bone. First shots did not hurt. Second shots wow! How I got through it baffles me. Third shot, no pain just uncomfortable. I'm 42. Noticed a difference after first week; now we are 2 weeks out, right knee is stiff again and am having pain and problems walking. Left knee is hurting but nothing like before the shots. Am hoping insurance will authorize TKR for the right one. Am basically unable to do anything pain free.",2
"I tried taking Celexa for 1 month. The main reason for choosing this medicine over others was the cost - very affordable.  However, I was taking it for sadness, fatigue, irritability and anxiety and Celexa only made me more tired.  It did work well for the stress and anxiety, but I slept a lot.  I often fell asleep when I didn't want to.  I am now trying another medicine that does not make me sleep, but it is very expensive and does not knock out the nerves and stress like Celexa does.",2
"Atralin has been fine and has cleared up my acne and made my skin clearer and smoother. I am 38.  But one thing I noticed, since using the product is that if I do get an occasional breakout, it is hard to heal, scabs a lot and then leaves a small pockmark when healed.",2
"I've been taking this on and off for a few months now (but taking as prescribed) for chronic and severe sinus infections. I recently had surgery for it and am still taking it. I am honestly hoping to be off it soon. I have noticed several side effects - I can't sleep well but always feel tired and without energy; I'm moody; excessive sweating with a horrible breakout or rash over my chest, shoulders and back; my skin is dry and my face looks fuller. ",2
"Had the implant January 12th 3 months after having my second baby. Thought it was great at first no period not having to worry about contraception, then started to struggle with my weight found it hard to control it constantly feeling hungry, more headaches than usual, spots on face and always feeling down. Thought it was down to busy tired mum running around after two babies but husband and friends noticed a change in my mood, etc. Getting it taken out in a couple if weeks. Friend had the same problem and felt better after having it removed.",2
"I was put on Bunavail because of the constipation I was having on the Bup's. I used to take 2mg twice a day...my Doc told me how great this new Bunavail is, yada yada. The first two days of it, I was going thru WD's! My moods were awful, I was clammy but hot, sweating, chills, no appetite. So my Doc tells me to double my dosage, and finally I feel better...no more WD's, but my gosh...the mood swings...I'm like a crazy woman on her period, ready to snap on the next person that irritates me. That's NOT like me, I'm always rainbows and butterflies, and I hate this. While the constipation has gotten better, it's still there. I'd rather have to take laxatives then deal with these mood swings. I'll give it another month until my next appointment",2
Took metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide for several years.  Seemed to reduce blood pressure to acceptable levels.  About a year ago I experienced shortness of breath at times along with some fluid in lungs.  Turns out that metoprolol (Lopressor) can cause that.  Got off the metoprolol and lungs cleared up.  Not taking it anymore.,2
"Loosened phlegm but makes you feel VERY dizzy, drowzy, and dehydrated.",2
"Female age 32 with history of kidney stones. Went to ER for kidney stone pain on a Friday, was given a shot of Flomax and a prescription to take daily. Saw urologist and received CAT scan on Monday - one 2mm kidney stone in ureter and two more (one in each kidney) to come. On day six of Flomax and going to stop taking it - feeling very dizzy, nauseous, tired with chills/low fever at night. Still haven't passed the stone but can't take these side affects. Doctor said I can go back on Flomax anytime if my kidney stone pain comes back and I need it to help pass this stone.",2
"I had good grades. I could concentrate. But, I became very aggressive. I had to stop taking.",2
"Ativan was prescribed to me for severe anxiety. I took 2mg one to two times daily. I took the medication for two months. I however, DID NOT follow the advise of my doctor and quit cold turkey. It was five days of hell for me. I did not sleep AT ALL,  I had panic attacks, trouble breathing, and severe sweating for two more weeks when I did start sleeping again. The medication was very helpful but when I quit the side effects were just about unbearable. My advice is use this medication with caution and follow doctor instructions to the latter.",2
"I have taken Relpax 3-4 times, and strangely enough I have had extremely vivid nightmares.  This is very unusual for me because I'm not the type to have nightmares.  Normally, I might have one per year, and suddenly as I have taken this medication I've had nightmares each night that I have taken the medication.  I think it's not a coincidence since this has already occurred 3-4 times in less than 2 weeks.",2
"I started taking Apriso after being diagnosed with Crohn's August 2012. My Gastro doctor started me out on the ER capsules in the morning. I didn't really notice many side effects at first. I actually felt better than I've felt in years. Crohn's symptoms are almost completely gone, however, I still have a bad day every now and then. A few weeks in, I'm having horrible pounding headaches, dizzy when I stand from sitting, heart burn, excessive sweating, dry mouth, nausea, food taste metallic, and loss of appetite. I'm afraid if I stop this medication all the Crohn's issue will return. I would rate it a 2 because the med works if you can tolerate the side effects.",2
I am a long term ultram user (maybe 2 or 2 years). I have osteoarthritis. Now I feel like I am taking the medicine just to get rid of the headache and runny nose that I get when I do NOT take it. I am trying to STOP taking it and maybe switch to arthritis strength tylenol. At least I won't have a headache and a runny nose. I think it addressed my pain very well some years ago but now it's not working because I still have arthritis pain.,2
"Effexor is risky. The years that I took Effexor were fantastic, but the withdrawal symptoms are just as bad as everyone says. In fact, after about three years Effexor stopped working for me out of the blue. There was no controlled withdrawal. My symptoms were the &quot;brain zaps&quot; or an &quot;electric shock&quot; feeling in my head. My mind felt like a skipping record. I was severely depressed and cried all the time. That said, I am now starting to take it again after taking Prozac for several years. Prozac doesn't make me feel as good as Effexor did, so I'm taking it again. Hopefully I'll have another few good years on it before I have to push through withdrawal.",2
On August 12 I had protected sex but we realized the condom broke. He came completely inside of me and I was freaking out!! I just got done with my period so I was close to ovulation. I got the pill the very next day and took it within 12 hours. 2 days after taking it I got another &quot;period&quot;. It's actually your uterine line shedding tricking your body to think that you already ovulated. Don't freak out ladies!! Stay calm so your period doesn't get delayed! I just got my period 4 weeks after my induced period. So it's right on time. The side effects however were not pleasant. I've been having headaches and kind of nauseous. My period seems heavier (just got it today) and the cramps are worse but overall I'm just happy to have gotten my period.,2
"Got this in March it's now end of August. It does a good job of birth control because I've had unprotected sex over 3x with this and I'm not pregnant. but its so annoying because I spot for 3 weeks, that's way too long. It's stressful and I hate it. I gained 3 pounds, I'm only keeping it for the birth control and because it regulates my addictive sexual activity.",2
"I have been on Loestrin 24 FE for four months now. It was prescribed to me after I finished breast feeding. For the most part I liked the pill until I started having my period twice a month and it lasts for a week, on top of that I get very, very irritable right before they start. I occasionally get dizzy spells.",2
"Started taking it this evening and the injection didn't hurt at all, didn't even feel it.  I did feel a little  itchy and burning sensation after though.  I did have a little panic attack after I think I had just worked myself up for all of the worse side effects.  It's been a few hours and haven't felt any nausea or any other side effects. Hopefully it will stay that way.  Excited to start this journey.",2
"Prescribed to help with rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.  Takes some of the joint swelling down, but only after sleeping (i.e. not doing ANYTHING with my body). Doesn't help with pain management unless taken with an opiate analgesic. So far, only side effects experienced are moderate headache (especially if I don't eat), insomnia (only 4-2 hours sleep instead of 2-8) and excruciating shoulder pain about 2 hours after dose.  Ironic, considering I'm trying to stop the joint pain.  Still, much better.",2
Dr. doubled dose to 2 tablets per day...within 24 hours feet were swollen but blood pressure did go down.....can't win!,2
"I've been taking the meds for 12 days which was prescribed 3 pills every 8 hours 200mg for 3days.  I have the metallic taste in my mouth, burning sensation in stomach, diarrhea, nausea, lost of appetite..I can't bare taking 3 a day but tomorrow I will try",2
I have chronic fatigue with my MS.  I tried Provigil several months ago but it gave me a severe headache and I felt spaced out.  Tried Nuvigil just today and felt jittery in the early part of the day and a bit light headed but I think I'll stick with it and see if I get the benefits others describe.  I didn't take a nap as usual today and I hope to feel more focused and energetic with my job soon.,2
"I tried Qysmia 2.2 dosage for 43 days and lost 12 pounds  but the side effect I didn't desire any junk. I didn't take every day as prescribed because of the side effects. Insomnia, dry mouth, tingling in feet, tiredness.  The worst side effects has come since I have been off the medicine for 4 days. I have pain in my genital area and constant chills.  I now see that these are listed as possible side effects. I think that people should return back to the post to warn of what comes after you withdraw from the medicine.  Not worth the 12 pounds weight loss. Everything comes with a price.",2
"I had Implanon inserted in December 2009. The insertion was fine and I had very little pain or bruising. It has now been in my arm for nine months and I am having to deal with the following: Acne, increased appetite, loss of sex drive and horrible mood swings and I generally feel very low in myself. I am due to have it taken out today and hope that I can return back to the woman I was.",2
"I've been taking doxycycline for a month due to a trip to Africa, I will be taking it for a further month now that I am home. I get awful heartburn and nausea and would not choose to take it again. My parter takes an alternative, more expensive treatment with no side effect what so ever, I will be choosing that medication in future!",2
"I have mixed feelings about Skyla. The people were right when they said getting in was painful. Hands down one of the top worst feelings ever. Still get period, still get cramps. But..... I never got never got pregnant and that is great.",2
"This medication worked very fast except I got an yeast infection by the 3rd day. Women, definitely take Canesten during the course of this medication, if you are sensitive to antibiotics.",2
"I have mixed feelings about viibryd. I'm switching off of it now, after about a year on it. I found that I did help, but seemed to make me more anxious at first. I didn't have any other side effects.  After being on it for a while, I noticed if I was even a couple hours late on my dose, I would be a complete mess--crying, panicking, just feeling terrible. I've never had such a strong reaction to just being late on taking a medication. I'm not even talking about missing a full day.  This is the main reason why I wanted to get off of viibryd. I stayed on it for fear of withdrawal symptoms and my depression and anxiety worsened. Currently taking celexa and today is my first day with no viibyrid.",2
Ok so I was due to start this at 2pm. It's now 8:40pm and I'm still struggling to choke down the first dose. I don't wish this on anyone and I shudder to think I have to do this again in the morning. Just make it taste like water!,2
"I'm a 24 y/o male and have been on Topiramate for almost a month.. Started with 22mg daily increment and increased dosage by 22mg every week. I was suppose to make it up to 30mg daily, but that hasn't happened. . The first week was good. Second week I did notice the pins and needles sensations all over. When I got up to 22mg per day my brain fog was BAD, my anxiety sky rocketed, and I seemed to have more headaches. I've started to have panic attacks and have been scared to drive lately or even go to the store which is so unusual for me. I am also sleeping hours upon hours at a time and I am also getting tingling sensation in face and arm which is scaring the heck out of me. Going to stop taking without consulting doctor.",2
"I am 23, no kids. I have had Skyle for almost two years now. The insertion was not bad at all (2 out of 3 pain). When I left and went home is when I was in serious pain. I was miserable. Bent over crying and it hurt so bad it made me vomit so my husband took me to the ER thinking it had gone out of place, turns out it was &quot;normal&quot; pain. So they gave me pain medicine and sent me home. After that I bled for 3 weeks still with cramps and spotted for a few months, while still getting my period. Everything has been fine up until about two months ago and I've started getting really bad cramps again. Like I did when I first had it inserted. I am not sure what is going on but with this much pain I am seriously considering getting it taken out.",2
"Although for some reason Lyrica seemed to make my pain medications oxycontin last longer or work better, Lyrica made my legs swell up. The pain was unbearable from the swelling and in the end I had a lot of broken veins. If you're swelling up and your doctor says &quot;oh, you just ate too much salt this week&quot; get another opinion to get off Lyrica and see if the swelling doesn't stop. I wish I could take it, it really did help. Good luck to all with Fibromyalgia, it's an awful and painful disease.",2
"I've started on Phentermine 11 Aug 2012 with a starting weight at 292.4lb. Today, 14 Aug 2012 I weigh 293.0 lb. I've started back walking a mile on my break at work. I will start working out at home for an hr, 3-4 days a week. Let's see what happens.  I am so tired of this weight. I have let myself go. I know how to eat healthy, but have just let other things get in the way. Now my mind is set and I am ready for the new me.",2
"I have had Mirena for a little over a month now. As soon as I put it in I got acne, its been a problem for me when I was in my teens and was almost completely gone by time I was 20.  I am 22 almost 23 and now it's almost as bad as when I was 12. I have to wash my face every day with acne creams, to help control the break outs, most of which are on my back. I have all sorts of mood swings and my husband says that I haven't really been the same since it was inserted. I am going to be looking into a way to off set this. Every once and a while I will get the breast tenderness, but it's not much worse then when I was breastfeeding and often goes away in minutes. I have a horrible time remembering to do things, so when I was taking a pill everyday I had to rely on my cellphone alarm going off to take the pill and even then if it wasn't close by or if I was in the middle of doing something I wouldn't stop to go take the pill. I love that I don't really have to worry about it.  My doctor told me since I hadn't been getting my period while breastfeeding, Mirena would more then likely stop my periods, which so far I haven't even spotted one day.  I haven't had any problems with weight gain. I have maintained the same weight as when it was inserted, though I am trying now to start losing weight, so we shall see how that goes. Overall at this moment I would recommend it to others. As long as I can off set this funk I am in.",2
"I had basically perfect skin until my freshman year of college. my doctor prescribed this to me and it worked for my acne on my chin the next day and basically clearly my forehead. The after using it once a day, my skin became dry and irritated. it was flaky and my skin broke out because of the dead skin on my face. It really doesn't work anymore and I keep trying it but now I realize it's too harsh for my skin and I should use something lighter. also any type of moisturizer on my face made it burn like hell.",2
"I have been dealing with insomnia on and off for over 3 years. I have always managed it with OTC meds like Unisom. Finally decided to see a doc about it after having to take 3-4 Unisom a night (I was feeling like a zombie till 3 am!). She prescribed 22 mg of Vistaril - take one at bed time. Last night was my first time using it and it took a few hours to get me to sleep. All night I had weird, vivid dreams and it was hard to tell if I was asleep or awake. I felt on the brink of deep sleep, but still awake. It's hard to describe. I am going to give it a week and see how it goes. I was a bit groggy this morning, but not like on Unisom.",2
"I started Victoza just over 3 weeks ago and I have had no side effects whatsoever.  I feel great and am losing weight, and for the first time in my life I've experienced feeling full and satisfied.  I've never had that feeling before.  I've felt full (after eating much more than when on this drug) but never satisfied.  It was a remarkable feeling.  I've had a great experience and I hope to continue as I've a lot to lose.  However, I do fear the potential for pancreatic cancer and will do more research on this.",2
"This medicine worked to relieve my nasal congestion, but gave me severe insomnia.  I stayed up for an entire night.  I also experienced dry mouth. ",2
"Crestor was doing a very good job in bringing my total cholesterol from 242 to 121. However, after a year and a half I could not stretch without pulling a muscle. I am 34 lbs. So the dosage was reduced to 1/2 of a 2mg tablet, which did not work, my number came up to 219.  I also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), recently I got a bad GERD pain in my chest, I had to take an antacid before, during and after I ate. When I quit Crestor the pain and the head confusion went away. I felt great.  Now my numbers from exercise, eating the right foods that help lower LDLs and raise HDLs have got my total to 232 with all LDLs in normal range with my HDLs high.  My doctor is now trying me on fibrates.",2
Very active and fit- 32 yrs old and have been on Aromasin for almost 3mo. I was on Tamoxifen for 2 years previously. It was a cake walk compared to Aromasin. I haven't slept through the night a single night since starting A. My hands are swollen and weak and they ache all the time. I have joint pain all over and am terribly stuff when I sit in the same position for long. I'm tired and have a hard time working out (I used to live for this)  My vision is blurry sometimes.  This blows but I'm hoping the SEs will improve soon.,2
I have had an okay time with this medication. My back pain has been so severe that I have been on opiates for about 2 years.,2
"I am 24 and had a stent put in with 92% blockage. I was put on Metoprolol 22mg along with atorvastatin and effient. The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body. Very tough emotionally, but adjusting.",2
"I took Cymbalta for the first time last night. Within an hour I was falling asleep on the couch, which I never do. Usually I have insomnia, but I slept through the night. However, when I woke up I was violently nauseous and had to take an anti nausea medication (which I sometimes use when my anxiety is really bad cause it makes me sick). I attempted to go about my normal day, but found myself having to take two naps because I was excessively tired. I've been watching and reading about this medication all day and I am terrified to take another dose because of the side effects and ultimate withdrawal I'll experience if it doesn't work out. I noticed today, through my headache and tiredness that I felt more calm. I'm praying it works for me!",2
"Seems to help. I take 30 mg, twice a day in a combination with Lortab 3. Have not had any of the listed side effects other than, I tend to anger quicker, nothing that can't be controlled.",2
"I started a very low dosage and worked upward until I found what worked for me (40mg). However, as my depression got worse and worse, the Prozac actually stopped working altogether no matter how much it was increased! It's a good medicine for mild to moderate depression, but there are better choices for major depression.",2
"So I've been on this birth control a little over a month, and now that I read some of the reviews I know I'm not crazy. This pill makes you feel depressed. I'm on the second pack and skipped the sugar pill because I did that with the first birth control I was on and my periods went away. Now I haven't got an actual period but I've been spotting for about 2 days now. Two of days I noticed more blood but still not a lot my regular periods are usually 2 days long so hopefully this is the last day of this weird bleeding. Also the blood looks different first it was very light like a pinkest color, than brown, the back to that light pink color then dark red and looks watery.",2
This medicine (and Synthroid) raises my blood pressure.,2
"Suprep Bowl Prep Kit was the vilest tasting thing I've encountered in 22 years.  If you plan to use this preparation for a colonoscopy, find a way to mask the taste.  The Suprep left me with a very upset stomach nearly 24 hours after ingesting the first of the two bottles.  At times, while drinking the preparation I experienced some nausea.  It did do the job of cleaning the colon, but it took a very long time to do it.  The drug may work wonders for others, but I won't touch it again.",2
"I have been on the Viibryd for a month.  I have had NOTHING.  I feel no different than before I started.  No side effects and no change.  Recently, I have been on the 40mg for 2 weeks now and I cannot sleep and I wake up SOAKED in sweat. This is my first attempt at an antidepressant, so maybe it is not the right one for me.",2
"The second pill made me feel confused, anxious, lightheaded.",2
"I was origininally on Loestrin 24 Fe for almost three years, I then switched to this because loestrin 24 Fe switched brands I guess? So I figured I'd try something new. I'm 19 and have now been on lo loestrin for almost 2 months, I have noticed a major breakout of acne in my chin area. I never breakout so it was very unusual for that to occur, I as well noticed a weight gain of abuout 2-2 pounds just in these two months. I am pretty active and eat well and normally can't gain weight, so I am still not happy about that. I have also noticed having intense headaches, I'm not sure if its from the birth control, but i've never had them like this before. The pill does decrease any cramping or nausea I had previously. Probably going to switch back",2
"It makes you go, that's for sure. Took one before bed and got up to give my baby a bottle at 4.30am, gave him his bottle but when I was putting him back into his cot I felt sudden sharp cramping and I knew I had to run to the bathroom. Had violent diarrhea and intense cold sweating, I started feeling nauseous and extreme abdominal pain, so bad that I woke up on the floor covered In sweat, I don't know how long I passed out for but I was so confused when I woke, the pain was gone. I passed out cause my body couldn't handle that level of pain ..I've had two children and didn't pass out...this stuff is  unbelievable",2
"I took my first dosage around 2pm and by the next morning I felt drunk and disoriented. My side effects are as follows: grinding my teeth, awaking off and on all night, shaking, dilated pupils, mild stomach ache and headache, fatigue, weakness, nervous, loss of appetite (which I was okay with) and diarrhea. I couldn't stand for very long therefore I didn't even attempt going to work. So, I stayed in bed all day and probably by 4 or 2pm that day I felt a lot better. Still groggy but I could function. I skipped taking another dose and went to work the next morning feeling like it was still in my system and I felt good. I'm weaning onto the medicine by 1/4 of the pill for a week then 1/2 the second and so on. Seems to be working and no side effects.",2
"I've been on this birth control for almost a year. It started out great and my periods were regular and light. My breasts also got bigger, which was an advantage. Right away I noticed the biggest change in my lifestyle: my sex drive plummeted and I became extremely emotional. I went from having sex with my boyfriend every day to maybe once a week, and it so difficult for me to get turned on. I'll watch a commercial with a dog in it and cry, or sob uncontrollably when my boyfriend does something nice for me. It's ridiculous. I also gained a lot of weight since starting Mononessa, and always feel tired and foggy. It has been effective with preventing pregnancy, but is not the right birth control for me.",2
I have had nexplanon for almost a year and it is effective in one way but I have had so many problems not having a cycle or two months of a cycle. Emotional moods to laughing to crying to smiling to being depressed.,2
"I got this implant on the 13th of November 2012... I've been bleeding since. Plus, acne ! Everywhere. I've been on accutane when I was younger and now I have acne all over again because of this implant. It is currently March and this marks my 2th month and I'm STILL bleeding. My gynecologist says it takes about 2 months for the bleeding to subside. If my bleeding doesn't stop by the end of the month then I'm getting this out of me.",2
"My first shot of depo was great, no mood swings or any other side affects other than some very light spotting. Happy with my first shot, I got a 2nd but it didn't turn out as the first shot did. I'm happy because there's no mood swings or really any mental side effects which is why I switched from the pill. However, I was told my period would completely go away or just be light spotting, but for some reason I have now been having a normal/heavy period for over a month now which concerning. I've also been experiencing a lot of headaches, and cramps that can get so bad they'll sometimes wake me up from dead sleep. I'll be going to the doctor soon to get off of this, blood loss is not fun :c don't think this is super common though",2
Was on Bydureon and my insurance quit covering it. It worked really well. Now I have to use Tanzeum which does not work nearly as well. May need to up the dosage.,2
"I just started Sprintec four days ago, this is the first birth control ever for me I am 23. The main side effect on day one was nausea, I was so sick I slept by the trash can that night. It has been getting better though. I will write an update review when I finish the first pack.",2
"I have experienced chronic constipation since I was diagnosed with systemic lupus 12 years ago.  I have tried nearly every over the counter remedy with only short-term relief.  I have been on 182 mg Linzess for a month and am happy when it actually works.  Maybe it is too soon to decide if it is a great drug to relieve my constipation, but so far, it only stimulates a bowel movement 2-3 days/week; most often within 2 hours of taking the drug on an empty stomach.  The other days, I am bloated, constipated and full of gas.",2
"I have been taking Savella for a year now for my fibromyalgia. I was weaned off Cymbalta and on to Savella. The first month or so when starting on Savella I had extreme nausea, but when it passed it was worth it. It worked really well on my fibro symptoms and allowed me to be somewhat active again (gardening, swimming, chasing my young children). About 2 months into taking Savella I started having dizziness and heart palpitations that caused me to suddenly feel like I was going to pass out and then I would vomit. My doctor lessened my 30mg dosage to 20mg and the episodes stopped, but my fibro symptoms slowly started coming back. So then I went up to 22mg to treat the symptoms. Now, after being on it for a year it has stopped working.",2
Helps overall but leaves me with a terrible hung-over type grogginess until mid-afternoon the next day. Doctor said it should go away after a week but no luck - still had the next day druggy haze feeling even after 3 weeks on it.  I do still use it occasionally for bad shoulder or back spasms but not everyday for my fibromyalgia anymore.,2
I took Doryx for 2 months and it worked. I stopped taking it and it started coming back in 2 months. Now I paid $220 to buy it again as my insurance would not cover it.,2
"I have been on Yaz for hormonal acne for about 3 years now. Let me just say the first two years were awesome. No chin breakouts, less oily. Now for some reason it is no longer working. I am getting painful cysts again around my period. I thought it was temporary but I started noticing it in December and it is now September. I'm nervous to get off of it for fear it will be worse. It worked for me for some time but now I have to find something else.",2
"This was great birth control for the first 2 months. No mood swings, no weight gain, however my chest size did increase a little. My third month, unfortunately I started experiencing leg cramps which made me have to switch.",2
"Worked great on my cough. Made me a bit restless though. I was able to take it during the day and not be sleepy, so that was a plus.",2
Every day I'm nauseous and headaches. It works great though.,2
Really good for sleep when not too anxious(22mg) but when over anxious doesn't work for me. I didn't find it very good for suicidal tendencies/depression.,2
"At the moment I am having an episode of severe depression and anxiety which has been extremly debilitating for the last 2 months. Im unable to work, socialise or even speak to anyone at the moment. As this is the worst ive ever felt I decided i now need medication. I have been on 20mg setraline for almost 2 weeks. I take it in the morning. I have had trouble sleeping some nights as I just feel wide awake. It has stopped me sleeping through the day which I was doing a lot of. When I do eventually sleep it is a bit hard to get up in the morning but once up im fine. Ive had a couple of good days and bad. I sometimes feel a little 'wired'. Ive invested in a herbal tablet to help me sleep at night. Im hoping I will feel normal again soon!",2
"I am 18 and I have been using the shot for 8 months. If you do not want to get pregnant, this IS the shot for you! I had a period with the first injection but ever since then I haven't and I love that. It is great because it isn't that painful when receiving the shot, and it is awesome not worrying about it for 3 months. The problems I have with the Depo shot is weight gain. I am 2'3 and was 122 pounds, so I thought I wouldn't gain weight, and I was very wrong. I now weight 120! I also am very moody and sometimes feel depressed. Next month I will be changing to the patch because early aged osteoporosis runs in my family.",2
"I have taken Miralax since I was 3 years old due to a medical condition. The product does what it should, but after about 3 years it acquired a flavor that I can't stand. I mix it with other drinks and over time it ruins those drinks for me also. If you can get past the flavor it is a miracle product.",2
"It seemed to help but I have lost all sense of taste and smell. If I had known this was a possibility, I would not have taken this medication. Not happy.",2
"Have been on zoladex once a month injections for a year now. Awful side effects for the first 8 months . Terrible joint pain, hot flushes, bowel habit changes, bad mood swings, complete lack of sex drive, depression that drive me to contemplate my place on earth, lethargy . Also massive weight gain ....Over 2 stones. The plus is I now am free from periods and the horrific pain I endured. Prior to zoladex I had an ablation where they burnt off my womb lining. This was unsuccessful . Make your choice as the side effects are really awful but the pain I suffered was so life limiting . I would be screaming out in pain unable to move a muscle. Now I am pain free.",2
"Been on Cymbalta now for approximately 1 year. My moods are stable, less pain, generally feel better. However, one side effect is unacceptable. On this medication, I feel like I am no longer male. Less desire, followed by greatly reduced sensitivity, as well as inability to maintain an erection longer than a minute make married life most difficult. I tried to come off the drug. It is extremely difficult. Dizziness, light sensitivity, horrible headaches, and extreme irritability.",2
"I thought that this would clear up my face, (was hoping at least), and it didn't. I mean I break out just like I did before and it's annoying, however if you don't have acne and you want a good birth control I highly recommend this because it really does do it's job. My periods are always on time, and they aren't unbearable at all. I think I gained weight, but then it went away. So it didn't affect my acne, and I think it's a good birth control.",2
"I'm 34 years old with 2 kids. I had the Paragard IUD inserted 3 &amp; 1/2 yrs ago shortly after the birth of my 2nd child. The procedure was quick. I experienced a little discomfort but nothing unbearable.  Fast forward to 2012, I requested my GYN remove the Paragard IUD today. It took all of 30 seconds to remove  but did leave me spotting. My reasons to remove included the following: 1) shortly before my period I would spot for approximately 3-4 days and then proceed to bleed for a minimum of 9 days 2) constant vaginal discharge which resulted in me having to wear a panty liner daily and 3) since it's insertion, my cravings for sugar have tremendously increased. After 3 years, I finally just had enough of dealing with these side effects.",2
"Sexually frustrated me and I was a little bit aggressive coming onto it. EVERYONE has a specific anti-depressant that will work for them. It's all trial and error. However, even though it didn't work for me, I'm a fan of the medication. Prozac, however, did the job.",2
"Lost about 8% of body weight (20 lbs) initially. I'm going into month 3 and I'm not sure this is reducing my sugar enough. Big issues with various infections, like 2 in the past 2 months. It does also seem to CAUSE sugar cravings, as the last reviewer mentioned.",2
I have had reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome for 11 years and I now take 2400mg of Neurontin a day with very little side effects. I would rate it a 2/3.,2
"It worked but the first day of taking after my vertigo issue I slept all day &amp; all night. Took second day and all I did was sleep, I can't take it and function and definitely go to work and take it. I walk around in a fog even if try to keep busy while taking during the day.",2
Is expensive but takes the edge off. I use for L-spine DJD and combine with 300mg Neurontin for best effect. Less problems with gastrointestinal upset without hassle of narcotics. Some skin irritation (ask for a sample if you have sensitive skin). Some trouble keeping in place.,2
"Great at lowering blood pressure (220 to 124 using 3 mg). But body aches, dull headache often noted. My doctor wanted me on 20 mg but that was too uncomfortable.",2
"I was diagnosed with narcolepsy a little over a year ago. As I was just about to start my senior year of college, I knew I needed to start a medication in order to get through classes and homework so I started on Nuvigil 120mg. I immediately noticed a huge difference in my quality of life. I had forgotten what it was like to be focused and alert throughout the day and would suddenly realize it was 9pm and I was totally exhausted. However, side effects started to take over the benefits for me and I started to experience problems with jitters, a sort of lingering morning sickness feeling, and anxiety. I stopped taking it due to these side effects, but sometimes now I feel the exhaustion is worse than dealing with the side effects.",2
I need help. I'm 12 years old and I've been struggling with depersonalization and derealization. It started after a massive panic attack and during the panic attack my body felt numb my heart was going crazy my vision also went weird and after that nothing's been the same I fell very detached and like I'm in a dream. I went to my GP and he prescribed me 3mg of citalopram with 20 mg of stresam. It's now day two and last night I woke up sweating and felt as if I was twitching I also have stomach pain and I feel very anxious and scared that it won't work and I'm very panicky about taking it after reading the side affects I can't stop over thinking and I feel I'm on the verge of having another panic attack I'm so nervous and I need advice.,2
"I've been taking Arava for 12 months or so now. It worked in the early days but now, I have quite severe pain and am looking at starting to take Infliximab along side the Arava.  With regards to side effects, none apart from the persistent, annoying tickly cough, which I've had now for about 2 months.",2
After having tried everything available - natural/diet/hormonal - fluoxetine is the only thing that combats my severe PMS.  Downside is complete lack of sex drive and blunted emotions.  Going to try to reduce from 20mg every day to 2 weeks before period.  ,2
Knocked the cough but I still have the cold.,2
"IMPORTANT: I started Yaz about a year ago and at first I noticed nothing. Then I became extremely irritable towards my boyfriend for no reason. My breasts grew a full cup size (plus), BUT Yaz gave me a yeast infection for four months and made me gain ten pounds. I know everyone is different but I really did not notice how much weight I gained, my infection is terrible and I am switching.",2
"I've had BV for a while but I thought it was in response to getting the mirena IUD a few months ago. My doctor just prescribed me the 2 pills a day for 2 days of metronidazole, and my last day to take the medication is tomorrow but my symptoms have hardly improved. Maybe a little better on the smell, but still itching. I've been avoiding having sex due to some research on the internet telling me I shouldn't do so while on the medication, but had sex once and there really wasn't any pain. Hoping the symptoms will clear up but I'm feeling discouraged since I've been on the meds for 2 days now.",2
I am new at bc. I just had a baby in Nov. 2012 and got the shot in Dec. 2012 by Jan 12 I started spotting and I have my period now for two weeks non-stop. That has me in a terrible mood. Besides this no other complaints.,2
"I had Skyla placed in May. I have gained about 20lbs since then, which sucks. I'm not good with birth control pills so I guess I'm stuck with the weight gain.",2
"After using medication for 4 days my feet, legs and ankles swelled",2
"I'm on my last week of accutane and have been taking it for 2 months. All of my acne has cleared up except for one or two pimples but I still have acne scars left. My only side effect symptoms at first included dry lips, dry eyes, back pain, and blurry vision, but now I'm experiencing mood swings and depression. It is not severe but I have noticed that I've been acting different for no real reason. I honestly can't wait to get off the drug just to return to my normal self and feel like I have more control over my emotions. Overall, I think the side effects are worth it for the results that I've gotten from accutane, but I am worried that after I'm done taking it that my acne will return.",2
"This would be my second month on Junel. I've been on Birth Control for about 3 years now. I changed due to spotting and increased mood swings with my previous birth control. Since the switch I have had shorter periods about 2-3 days, but I have gained major weight and increased appetite. I switched up my regular exercise routine and still have not managed to drop the extra 2 lbs ",2
"I wanted to share my experience with Kariva because I've been on it so long, 11 years. Pros include no weight gain, minimal mood swings, minimal bloating and shorter periods. Also some contraceptives can cause complications with getting pregnant when you actually Want to but this pill was effective when I used it and caused no issues when my husband and I decided to have a baby and stop using the pill. Took me two weeks to get pregnant. The only bad thing was awful debilitating migraines I dealt with for years that only stopped once I got off this pill. But it got me this far and I liked it better then a lot of other options.",2
"I have been on Sprintec for a year and a half. I have been on one other birth control previous to this. But with Sprintec I can always count on my period being the same time every month down to the day, it is also a very mild period and my cramps are about the same as they were. I also have a clear complexion. My complaints with this birth control would have to be the constant headaches and my sex drive has decreased quite a bit. I have also been sleep deprived at night and excessively sleeping during the day. My boyfriend also says that he has seen a difference in my mood since I have started this particular birth control",2
"Positive and Negative points . Makes you gain weight, feel moody and bloated. Fluid retention is bad.",2
"Ok, I took pictures of Wk0 and Wk1 and can see a big difference. That first week I had energy for days and could feel the pounds dropping off. Well, I'm into Wk2 and the energy has gone and the pounds don't seem to be dropping any more. I'm not gaining or having overwhelming hunger urges, but it seems to have fizzled a bit. I may call and see if I can up the dose to twice a day. Still not weighing in, waiting till I go back to the doctor's. No real side effects either. I hadn't done my 30 a day either so that will help. I'll keep you posted.",2
"Just in my first week of taking Celexa 20 mg for depression and mood swings. I have had a terrible headache since I took the first dose, very nauseous, and this yawning - gagging thing is worrying me, but mood wise I can already tell a difference. I hope it continues to work well.",2
"I have been on the Savella now for about 2 weeks and minus the chills some and hot flashes I think its actually working for the fatigue and fogginess. After recently going through radiation treatments for breast cancer, between the radiation and fibromyalgia my energy was so low I didn't think I would ever get out of bed again. But, like I said right now I'm thinking it's working miracles because I have more energy than I've had in years and pray it keeps working.",2
I was honestly writing for the last 30 mins while having an attack and I had taken one of my pills and I'm now sitting here &quot;fine&quot; ... also the page got closed and deleted all that I had been writing but it was probably for the better because I was honestly crying my heart out ..,2
"I have had panic disorder since I was about 2. It came and went and has caused me severe avoidance issues throughout my life.  I have been taking Paxil for about 8 years and it has worked wonders. It has been awesome...until recently.  Within the last 4 months, it just seems to have quit working well. I am having severe attacks from time to time, but I am starting to avoid things/situations.  It did make me gain about 30 pounds. I tend to clench my jaws and I startle easily, but those are the only side effect I notice. My family and close friends say I am much more of a pleasure to be around while I am on it.  I am not a mean person nor have anger issues, but I am just not so anxious and uptight.",2
I had my colon removed due to Ulcerative Colitis and have been running to the bathroom regularly. I was taking 8 Lomotil a day and still going 8 times a day.,2
"Started taking this medication about a week ago for Sciatica related pain, I had L2-L2 back surgery 3 years ago and get flare ups of pain from post surgery. It has helped the pain a fair bit, I still feel the right buttock pain when driving my car but other types of sittings is much better. The side effects are not so good, ablot of bloating. I feel like I have a balloon in my tummy; upset stomach; light headed and dizzy. With having vertigo in the past its hard to tell if is Vertigo or the medication.  Doctor wanted me to try it for 2 weeks but will go see him today after 1 week and have a chat with him about it. My dosage is 2 pills per day with food 20MG. I will ask if taking 1 per day may be and idea and who knows it may be enough?",2
"Have been on Celebrex for a year.  Initially for TMJ issues, then picked up mild-to-moderate rheumatoid arthritis last summer.  Been on it continuously except for a couple month long steroid regimens. I wouldn't call it a miracle medicine, but it knocks my inflammation and pain back about 20%.  Certainly not as effective as the steroid, but 20% is enough to keep me fully functional and unlike the steroid, I have minimal to zero side effects with it.",2
"I got Implanon in October 2011 while on my period. At the end of that cycle I did not get my period again until October 2012. It was the best year ever! No mood swings, not worrying about a pill, my weight stayed the same, and my sex drive increased. I'm also a huge whimp about needles but insertion didn't hurt. However, from Oct 2012- present (Jan 2013) I've gotten my period erratically from every other week to every 2 weeks. I'm going on vacation soon and the unpredictability of the medicine is starting to seriously irritate me (and put a damper on my daily routine). I hate to give it up because the first year spoiled me so much! But I'm afraid the aggravation of the unknown may have me removing it in the very near future..",2
I first got the Implanon in March of 08.. wasn't bad at all. I loved it up until March of this year. For the first two years I had my period at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year. In March of 203 I began having very heavy periods that lasted a good week or two. Then things really picked up this summer and after talking with my husband I decided to get it taken out and see if things straightened it (only time will tell). Thinking about getting a new one sometime next year. I really loved having it!,2
This was the nastiest stuff I've EVER drank. Mixed with cold lemon lime Gatorade and just had to keep drinking without breathing thru nose till it was gone. Took first dose at 2:30 pm and when I took second dose at 8:30 pm I almost didn't get it all down. Part of it came back up. Started working 30 mins after first dose and worked a lot quicker than I expected. That part I liked. Did have the chills while taking it and felt bloated from all the water which the water was easy for me to drink that amount of. But that taste....how in the world could some say it even remotely tasted like watered down grape? Tasted like pure nastiness!!!,2
"Initially, I was put on Lexapro and Klonopin (.2 mg 4 times a day) for panic disorder. After a few months, I was able to take the Klonopin as needed, usually once a day, and experienced very few symptoms of panic. After a year, I was feeling a lot better and decided to come off of it. The Lexapro really did help so much with my panic attacks, but I still had generalized anxiety. After a lot of therapy and lifestyle changes, my GAD was very well-managed and I was able to come off of Lexapro. 2 months down the road, I had a huge relapse due to a medical crisis and my doctor put me back on Lexapro. It pooped out and I was experiencing severe anxiety. I was on this medication 3 times for a total of 2 years.",2
"I was diagnosed with MS in late December 2013.  I started taking Copaxone the summer of 2014. I started off using the daily 20mg, then I switched over to the 40mg because I didn't want to give myself a daily injection. When I first started the 40mg, the side effects included sore injection site welts. Overtime, the side effects became worse. Now, every time I take the 40mg, I get very sore, itchy welts at the injection site, along with patches of itchy, rash bumps on certain parts of my body.  The other side effects happen randomly after an injection.  These include severe body aches and chills.  The symptoms are fever-like.  Other than that I feel an increase in my energy levels since taking Copaxone and my MS lesions have not spread.",2
"So I have experienced constipation ever since I was a kid, I am now 21, and have to regularly take lactulose liquid around once a week. I need something stronger for medication induced constipation and decided to take Ducolax in the morning around 11 to achieve a result by the evening. After dinner at 2 I felt completely cleaned out and had some minor cramping before dinner, however drinking lots of water seemed to make things move faster. I wouldn't recommend taking it all the time because it is strong but for constipation that won't budge with anything else, this works.",2
"I have been talking Pradaxa for 2 months.  I take with a full glass of water and have no side effects.  Definitely, it is better than Coumadin.  I have a glass of wine once in a while and have had no side effects.",2
I was prescribed this medication after a burn injury. My scars caused  intensive itching! I was ordered to take two tablets by mouth four times a day as needed for itching. Initially after my accident the medicine helped. I didn't really notice the side effects because I was on pain medication as well. Now here we are six months after my  accident. last night I had a really bad itching episode. I could not sleep. I decided to take the two Atarax. I slept through the entire night and the next day.  I woke up to a text message after text message from coworkers and my boss wondering why I didn't show to work!,2
"I was having a very hard time finding a pill that controlled my periods- I would be on a pill and get my period in the middle of my cycle or when I wasn't supposed to- or it would start too early or too late after the sugar pills. My doc suggested higher hormones, and I have been on Reclipsen for almost 2 years. It regulated and shortened periods- no breasts or weight gain, mild acne improvement. But it took me a long time to realize how nasty some of the emotional side effects have been! It brought out the worst in me (hyper sensitive, on edge, almost bipolar at times) and for the past 2 months I've also had extreme depression. So I am switching to Yaz which is supposed to help a lot with the emotional stuff due to lower estradiol.",2
"I've been taking this for a week and a half. So far, two different times I felt alarming numbness in one arm and dizziness - thought I was having a stroke. But it passed. Also, my breasts feel very tender, sore and heavy. They have not grown that I've noticed, though. I have also broken out (acne) more than usual. So I have experienced side effects. I'm going to try this pill out for a whole pack before I switch. I haven't experienced moodiness, which I was concerned about, because I am prone to melancholy. I would recommend that you try this pill and don't back out because of the negative reviews. Give it a chance. That's what I'm doing.",2
"I started using Saxenda about 3 1/2 weeks ago. I lost 12 pounds. I try not to eat after 8pm if I am not doing anything and I eat balanced meals, albeit with a little more protein than I should. My carb intake is very low due to diabetes. I am also trying to drink more water.  I work out at least twice a week and overall I feel lighter. I don't think I'll increase my dosage past 2.0 since it is expensive. My goal is to lose another 3 pounds by the end of the month and hopefully I finally be out of 300s by the end of the summer. Will update then.",2
"I have been taking this antibiotic for 2 days tomorrow being my last day...2. Twice a day. I had a horrible headache all day one day. I have felt anxiety and long winded or like out of breath for no reason just from easy everyday stuff that at 22 yrs old never bothers me. Also, a taste in my mouth it comes and goes as well as the nausea. Id say the nausea is the worst by far...its even if i take it after i eat or took it the night before and get up an eat..just nausious on and off.  And after all that i feel very sleepy like i just want to sit down and rest.Very mixed side effects, but im glad im not the only one.And im happy its working. I will say i been feeling the need to drink alot of water, my mouth feels dry to, water is helping!",2
"I am excited I have just started this weight loss medicine. I was placed on anti-depressants about  a year ago going through divorce, two grandmothers passed away then my dad.  So I went from 142 to 190 in a year!  The weight just keeps adding on which is making my blood pressure sky rocket. I have never been this heavy. Can anyone please give me advice!? I have been on it one day and it has def curbed my appetite and boosted my energy and mood. I know I need to workout more!",2
"I have been on Xanax, Ativan, Valium and most of the other drugs in the benzodiazepine family. I had built up a tolerance to most of them, so my Doctor prescribed Buspar.  Not being part of the benzodiazepine family, the effects are different and a bit more subtle then I have been used to, however, I have learned to appreciate the difference, because I was looking for something different.  Buspar at least for myself is looking promising.  I also have LexApro, but am hesitant to mix these two medicines at the same time.",2
"I was diagnosed five years ago as being bipolar and long term Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I have taken many medicines.  I felt so much better when adding Latuda that I went from 80 mg to 120 mg. I totally crashed. I was extremely depressed. I went off the medicine for six weeks. I started again taking 80 mg. I have been stable for five weeks. I also take lithium, Xanax, and Klonopin.  I stay on a strict schedule of exercise.  I am taking it day by day.  This is one of my most expensive medicines.",2
"Took 1 Mucinex DM around 2 PM. My experience is like many here. It worked great on my congestion, but it is midnight and I am wide awake. I found this site searching Does Mucinex DM keep you awake Yup, it does.",2
"One of the few anti-depressants I can tolerate. Most cause major sleep disorders, But with Prozac I don't have a problem. Not really sure if it helps much with panic attacks, I've tried 20mg and 40mg, sometime 40 mg seems to be a bit much.",2
"I have had a overactive thyroid disorder for 3 years which i had radiotherepy treatment for. Then it went underactive. So 3 years on i have been on levothyroxine &amp; regular blood tests. This is now for life. I have every symptom going for thyroid disorder,including raging acne. Hard lumps with red tops that stay for months at s time. Its hard NOT to try squeezing them ( even though we know we shouldnt) but thats mainly how it spreads. With the thyroid disorder,a lot of symptoms are hormonal. I thought at age 34 i shouldnt STILL be struggling with acne. So my doctor tried me on many creams,tablets ect. Until he gave me doxycycline. 30mg once a day. I must say these are brill. Just be patient.",2
I took Norvasc for approximately 2 years. It works fine lowering my blood pressure however it began to swell my gums and I was taken off it.,2
"I have been on Cymbalta for the last 2 weeks. The side effects have been difficult, stomach pain, the first few nights I couldn't sleep and thoughts raced through my mind, I was also having severe suicidal thoughts and I was still waking up from the pain and tingling sensation in my arms and shoulders. this is week three and I find that my mood has improved, but I'm sweating a lot. the fibro pain is present and I'm tired a lot. I tried taking it at night but find my chest hurting the next day so I switched to mornings on a full stomach and that's improved the stomach pain. I have restless leg and if I'm late on taking my next dose I'm jittery. I don't really know if its working for my pain, but my mood is much better, I'm not suicidal.",2
"I had been on this medication in the past and discontinued usage after I got pregnant. I  started back a few months ago, not realizing what the side effects were. I started gaining weight incredibly fast with no change to my diet and exercise and wasn't going to the bathroom unless I used a laxative. I was stumped and depressed about it up until yesterday when I spoke with a GI doctor. FINALLY I had an answer only after many visits to my family doctor and many co-payments which added up quickly (with no solution). Needless to say, I am so relieved to finally know what is going on with me... 20 lbs later but I see the light at the end of tunnel. Hope this helps.",2
"I have been trying to get my blood pressure under control for years!  My doctor has put me on a few medicines and after a while they just seem to not do much good.  My doctor gave me  EDARBYCLOR 40*/12.2 , twice a day.  In about 3-4 days my BP was lowing, which was VERY good, however I did notice I was having tummy problems.",2
Did an amazing job at getting me back to normal although I still suffer from panic attacks in my sleep. This also helped me greatly with my depression and made me feel normal again. ,2
"I've had the nexplanon implant for about a year now and I have mixed feelings about it. Yes, it worked great in the aspect of me not getting pregnant, however I did gain about 20 pounds since getting the implant.  It's also made it almost impossible for me to lose any weight, I've been exercising, eating healthy, etc. At first I would get a lot of headaches but they've died down now, and I've also been very gaggy, any little smell, texture, or sight of something gross makes me gag a lot. The one thing that's been keeping me from having it removed is the fact that I only get my period about 3-4 times a year. I used to have very painful cramps and heavy bleeding but since getting the implant my periods have been a lot lighter.",2
"Works well, a couple side effect to be aware of is acne, weight gain, and nausea",2
"I have been overseas for nearly a month now and started experiencing stomach cramps every morning for about a week and then continued with no BM, I'm 19 and have never had issues like this before. Possibly from the food I've been eating not sure, went to a pharmacy here in Thailand and dulcolax is what they gave me, took 2 pills at 2:30pm and went to sleep and woke up at 2am with stomach cramps, painful but bearable. A BM followed where it started off normal before ending in diarhea. Went again about 3 minutes later and am now back in bed at 4am feeling as though I'll get back to sleep with little pain, although my stomach is still rumbling. Not sure what all the fuss is about it's done the job and I feel good that my bowels are clear.",2
I started feeling better by the 2nd day. I feel a little funny but continued to take my  prescription. But on the night of the 4th day I  started to feel like my UTI was starting up again. On the 2th and last day of my prescription I have a burning sensation when a went to peed and my lower abdomen started to hurt again.,2
"It worked very well on the pain, but the severe burning of the nose lasted about 2 minutes until I ran water up and around it.",2
Have been taking Diovan 120mg twice daily along with hydrochlorothiazide 22mg for 2 years. Developed a shortness of breath which they told me was asthma problem that I never had before. I insisted it was the medication and was told it wasn't because it worked great for my blood pressure.  Had 2 near death experiences from &quot;asthma attacks&quot;. They stopped the Diovan and hydrochlorothiazide and I haven't had any problems with breathing.  I can be very active without losing my breath now.  Now trying to find something else that works as good on my blood pressure.,2
Works well,2
So I Been On The Nexplanon For 9 Months And Let Me Just Say I Hate It Because Of The Forever Bleeding It's Depressing Ugh!.But.....Then I Love It Because I Won't Get Pregnant ,2
Losartan is controlling my blood pressure very well but the heartburn that comes with it is going to force me into something else.,2
"I've been on this birth control for almost the full first pack now, I'm on the last pills in which I should get my period. It's been 3 pills and I haven't started it yet, I haven't had spotting, and I have all the symptoms of a period but the blood! Makes me nervous that maybe I have a blood clot or maybe it's made me infertile, and it makes me worry that I'm just going to get a horrible period in a week or two unexpectedly. I don't believe I'm pregnant, and this extended pill is way better with side effects than my one month pill, tri sprintec, was. I have a sex drive back and I am not as depressed. Obviously right now I'm very moody and nervous but that's not the normal.",2
"I have been on generic lamictal for nearly 2 months, on 300 mg for 1 week so far. I feel great when I wake up, depressed late am and afternoon, then decent in the evenings. Has anyone else had this with lamictal? My hope is that a higher dosage will do the trick. Thanks for any responses!",2
"I have had Parkinson's for 3 years. Six months ago, I was prescribed Seroquel 1/2 22mg at bedtime to &quot;clean up my sleep -anxiety&quot;. Works fine except I began wetting the bed after being asleep for 2 - 2 hours. The Seroquel makes me feel better but I have to solve the bed wetting problem.",2
"I've had the pleasure of being on sertraline 30mg for the last 8 years and I honestly believe I wouldn't be in this world if I wasn't. Every now and again I get tight jaw muscles or the odd day of nausea and every once in a  while, when I'm feeling really sorry for myself, I can eek out a tear and have minor meltdown. But nothing like before. This drug has saved me.",2
"I have been on letrozole for 2 months. I experience pretty strong joint pain in hands, fingers and feet especially upon rising in the morning. I look like Walter Brennan going to the bathroom. I am 24 and previously felt like 22, now I often feel 82. Have found something great to prevent weight gain and helps with the energy issue. Still working on vaginal dryness and libido. Have found an anti-inflammatory diet improves pain, energy and mental clarity.  ",2
"Initially medication was very helpful, but the longer I'm on it the less it helps. Now experiencing more day time sleepiness and I'm not able to stay asleep at night. Some nights it seems to help a lot, and then other nights nothing it doesn't seem to help at all. Getting harder and harder to rest and feel rested. Going to my doctor within the next 2 weeks to discuss different medication. RLS is very frustrating.",2
"I initially was prescribed this a few months ago at 3 mg 3xd, but it made me headachy and almost made my anxiety worse, so I quit taking it. I cannot take benzos, and recently am having more problems with anxiety, so I'm trying it at 2 mg 3xd. Now I see what others have been talking positively about. It's very subtle, but apparently I was just taking too much for my system before. So far, so good.",2
"I had the Implanon put in about 2 weeks after my son was born. I was going to try the Mirena, but my cervix was too small and the nurse couldn't insert it. So, she can back with an alternative-the Implanon. To be honest, I wasn't really into the idea of having something in my arm, but I knew I probably would miss pills again...so I had it inserted. That was April 2008. 18 months later, I'm liking it a better than I a year ago. Those first 8 months awful. I picked up a few pounds which I didn't mind because I've always been super skinny, but the unpredictable cycles were awful. My periods had always been light and short, but with the Implanon, they became MUCH heavier and longer! It's convenient, but it has its ups and downs!",2
I just got skyla yesterday. The pill was not working for me and I mentioned maybe wanting skyla. Before I knew it my gyno was in the room with the kit read to insert it. So I was not prepared so I didn't take any pain killers. My cervix is very far up so she had to clamp it to pull it down. The insertion was the worst pain I have ever felt down there. Felt like knives turning as she inserted it. After I was unclamped the pressure started to go away. I went home and took some tylonal and a nap. I woke up and went to work for 12 hours. Worst decision of my life. I recomend staying home the day you get it done.It's day 2 and cramps aren't horrible but still are there and I'm spotting. I'm to afraid to put a tampon in or try having sex,2
"Experienced CHF in 2010 induced by hypothyroidism which I had detected 30 years earlier but doctors couldn't confirm because of outdated TSH standards; also had hypotension &amp; hypoglycemia which were again medically unconfirmed until 2010 CHF with EF of 13%. Defibrillator implanted in 2010. Put on dofetilde in 2014 by new doctors cuz other docs had ignored effects of amiadarone on thyroid med plus amiadarone toxicity. In 2012 had tachycardia of 168, another new doc said dofetilde should have worked, recommended ablation, which was subsequently done. Experienced crippling fatigue, I phased out dofetilde a year later, no arrhythmias, energy returning plus clear thinking. Found ablation effective, dofetilde ineffective plus energy crippling.",2
"It cured my seizures I was having every night. I started taking this drug about a month ago and have gained 15 pounds already. I work out every day which didn't make sense to me so I had to look up the side effects. This medicine gave me terrible stomach pains no matter what I ate. terrible gas and diharea.  Gave me weird dreams, acne, bad pain to the point I couldn't sleep. I woke up feeling terrible every morning, I could go on forever. I'm going to call my doctor to get switched to a different one.",2
"Abilify changed my life. There is hope. I was on Zoloft and Clonidine when I first started Abilify at the age of 12.. Zoloft for depression and Clondine to manage my complete rage. My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean, irrational, and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I'm not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 2mg 2x daily. I am now 21 and better than I have ever been in the past. Only side effect is I like to eat a lot.",3
"I've been on every medicine under the sun (it seems) to manage the hypomania / mania of Bipolar2. Within a few days of starting Lamictal (was on Tegretol) it was as if someone had turned a light on in my head. Is this the way &quot;normal&quot; people think? was one of the first things that struck me. I sleep like a log, have no irritability, almost no anger (other than what would be considered normal). I am able to focus and my creative, impulsive thoughts have decreased enough to be manageable. It's a God send as I would perennially be in a state of hypo mania, which sounds great, but I was physically and emotionally exhausted. My libido is markedly lower but I wonder if that is perhaps an effect of not being hypo manic. I take 20 mg for anxiety.",3
"I have been on Tasigna for just over 3 years now (300mg x 2 times a day) Tasigna worked for me within a few weeks I have been in remission for basically the entire 3 years. As for the side effects, I feel sick to my stomach, tired,  severe leg and arm pain, I can't walk to long without needing a break, I went from working full time to not working at all because I am so tired all the time.... but hey I am in remission and alive so is all the above really a problem? Nope",3
"I have insomnia, it's horrible. My story begins with my PCP prescribing me Prozac to help with intestinal issues, because I was desperate I tried it, I was on it for 3 weeks. Stopped because of insomnia. Then I was prescribed Ativan, it out me out, but was very addicting. I had rebound insomnia. Then after about 14 days I hardly any sleep l tried the doctor one more time. I asked him about Trazadone. He told me that was a good medication for insomnia. He put me on 22 mgs, but stated I may have to figure out what dosage is best for me. I am currently taking 30 mgs, which is on the low range of what is prescribed, 400 mgs being at the high end for insomnia. I have the dry mouth and nasel congestion. I can live with that, I sleep now, yeah...",3
I live in Western Australia and disturbed by some comments on here. The cost of Embrel is cost of an ordinary prescription $32 for me the government pays the remainder of the cost to the chemist. I also go to the the medical centre every Saturday morning a Dr looks over my prescription and then he advises the nurse to administer the injection also no cost to myself and this is part of nurses duties. I am unsure of the country where people who have made comments referring to cost and that nobody is there to  administer the injection for them. I am very lucky to live in Australia as we have the best health system worldwide and everybody is  given the opportunity to receive proper medical help whether you are rich or poor there is no discrimination.,3
"I'm writing a second review on Vaniqa.  I started using this in February this year. Twice a day although some days/times I do forget. I just want to say how delighted I am to have found this. It has totally and completely changed my life! I had terrible male pattern hair growth all over my cheeks, chin, upper and lower lip and starting to grow down my neck. I used to pluck for up to 2 hrs a time every 3rd day but was never hair free. I wouldn't kiss anyone hello or goodbye as even plucked the stubble could be felt under my skin. 3 months on im not scared of being caught in bright sunlight I pluck around once a fortnight and it takes around 3 mins. The hairs that are coming through are soft and downy. My life is transformed.",3
"Hi all, My son who is 12 was diagnosed when he was in 2nd grade. We tried everything before medication. When we tried meds, the first one made him loose weight, fast. The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework. He does have issues with weight gain and sleep but he uses melatonin before bed if he feels like he will not be able to shut down. The shortage is KILLING us!",3
Very good response. It is so useful for me. ,3
I am 30 years old. I had a multiple composite spinal injuries 12 years ago. The aches and pains unbearable. I started taking anti-inflammatories about 2 years ago. I started getting injections every month of Toradol and &quot;Depo&quot; something. I am almost off all pain meds I mean I still have bad days but I can function again.,3
Reduced my pain by 80% and lets me live a normal life again!,3
"At initial testing my VL was over 2 million. I received my meds on saturday 2 days prior to testing to establish a baseline. I started when I received my pills. 2 days and 2 hours later I got my blood test to establish VL, I had taken 3 pills at this point and my VL was under 200.  VL  4 weeks was 0 . VL  8 weeks was 0 and  12 weeks was 0 .  2 weeks til my 1st EOT test. I feel cured. My side effects were next to nothing.",3
"Hey Guys,  It's been 4 months since my last post as I wanted to give it a few months to see how this was going to work.  So, I have been on Trulicity for six months now with Metformin.  When I hit the five month period the diarrhea, gas, sulphur belching finally subsided.  I now longer have any of those side effects.  However, I still haven't lost any weight at all, but I think that was because when I first started Trulicity I was taking it with Glimepiride and that one has a side effect of weight gain so I think the two meds were fighting each other lol.  I have been back on the Metformin with Trulicity for about a week now, so we will see what this does.  I was diagnosed as  stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD 3) so I am watching diet closely.",3
"Love this, no mouth sores, or ulcers like Wellbutrin gave me. I COMPLETELY QUIT SMOKING...this works.",3
"I love my Butrans patch!!! And it has relieved more than half of my pain, and I know this because I only have to take less than half of my pain killers now that I am on the patch! I change my patch every Saturday, but if I miss 24 hours my pain starts to reside again. If you are not a heavy drinker I would advise trying this patch!!!",3
I just hit my three month point on tretinoin .02% and I'm so happy. I was really  depressed about my skin during the first two months because I've never had bad acne and the cream made me have horrible acne. But I knew that was the worst part of it and after that was over I would be fine. I've inly had two zits since then and I'm only left with scars which is fine. Try it out even if you're scared because I was too and I'm so glad i did. It's worth it!,3
"This medicine saved my life. I was at my wits end with anti-depressants and was ready to give up. My doctor finally prescribed me this after many failed medications, I am so glad she did. I honestly do not know where I would be without Effexor XR. Side effects were very mild compared to other anti-depressants I tried. I was drowsy for the first couple days, but it was tolerable. I highly recommend this for severe depression. I would also like to mention for people to realize there is light at the end of the tunnel and YOU WILL GET BETTER, and to never give up.",3
I took Clomid for the first time last month. My husband and I tried for a year. I have a blocked Fallopian tube. I had to use estrogen medicine also because my uterine lining was too thin. Then my doctor had me use HCG shot to stimulate ovulation since Clomid can apparently mess up if/when ovulation occurs. I took the HCG shot over 2 weeks ago. I noticed some weird symptoms a few days ago and I just took multiple pregnancy tests. And I'm pregnant! So Clomid worked great for me so far. Yay!,3
I had a tummy tuck on Dec 18. The surgery was painful but the constipation from opioids from the surgery was just as bad. My plastic surgeon wasn't familiar with treating OIC so I called my primary care physician. She gave me Amitiza 24mcg. It took almost two days but it was amazing and I was so thankful. I had to remain on opioids for three weeks and the Amitiza worked so well I haven't had any issues!! Thank you Amitiza!!!,3
My experience during the nexplon is great not a pregnancy yet.  My only issue is it causes me too much bleeding. I get my periods from every other week up to 1 month up to 3 month . And it ruins My sex life,3
"Awesome!  My new boyfriend has a few issues; I believe it is all mental because of the bad relationships in the past.  He ordered this and then was prescribed this.  I told him he will go broke and he said it is sooooo worth it.  I orgasm every time, sometimes twice, and he does too.  Wow.",3
Had hep-c since early 20s and cirrhosis for the last 20 yrs. Tried interferon and riboviron which   had to stop treatments due to side effects that was terrible. Got on transplant list in Oct of 2014 and received a new liver on 19 Dec 2014. I was really blessed. Hep-c  was on a mission to destroy new liver but after 4 weeks of harvoni virus is undetectable .  Another blessing. Am still on treatments for 8 more weeks but 0 side effects so no problem.,3
"These reviews helped me so much when I first started Zoloft over 2 weeks ago that I wanted to post my experience.  After several weeks of increasingly worsening panic attacks at work, I ended up in the hospital. A year ago my psych Dr switched me from cymbalta to a mood stabilizer and things were good until November as stress at work increased.  I was depending on too much bromazepam to get through the day.  My GP started me on 20 mg of Zoloft and my anxiety was so bad also tremors for 4 weeks I was sure I would have to quit working or cut my hours.  But this Monday on week 2 was amazing.  I still have some anxiety but I seem to be able to handle it now.  It's like I have my confidence back. Good luck!",3
"I appreciate Lithium. Although my thyroid level is low, a supplement helps to equalize this problem. I've been through at least 20 different medications to stabilize my Bipolar diagnosis. I always wanted to be of normal state of mind. Lithium has allowed me to be equally yoked with myself. 300mg ER in the evening. 30mg of Seroquel in the evening. 20mg of  Cymbalta in the morning! I'm set! If I'm feeling anxiety I can add Busper or Loranzapam.",3
"My husband (age 23) has been having problems with Benign Prostate Hyperplasia, and erectile dysfunction as well.  We had gone from a fantastic sex life to one that was fading fast.  Then his doctor put him on a small daily dose (2 mg) of Cialis. Holy smokes!  He is bigger and harder than he was at 30. I am loving this. I have always had a powerful sex drive, and I was resigning myself to watching that fade away. I'm now clearing my schedule for action. I am honestly feeling more satisfied than I did at 22.  Ladies, if your guy is slowing down, push him to do this.  You may not have as much time to clean the house, but both of you will be smiling a lot more!",3
"My ears were ringing like crazy, I was almost to start break down and cry, but I was reading on one guys experience on how to best the ringing and everything he went thru I was going thru so I stsrted to do exactly what he said is to tune it out cause the more you think about it the worse it gets because with titinus you csn become your own worst enemy. So I keep reading on other testimonials and read alot  of people took zanax and it seemed to quite the ringing down.  So I had a zanax 0.2mg took it also because I couldnt sleep, the next day I woke up with a slight ringing and as the day progressed it went completely away Thank the lord.I truly believe that this oh s a condition thats related to the nrevous system there is s cure out.",3
My blood pressure has been around 120/30. Doctor prescribed Azor 40/3. Just 4 hrs later my reading showed 120/82. I was amazed. I am now on it daily. Thanks to Azor.,3
Been dealing with restless leg syndrome.for about 2 years. It kept me from falling asleep. First they gave me flexiril. And it did nothing. Than a miracle came about and I was prescribed reprinol and my legs haven't twitched since . Amazing drug I must say. My sleep has improved greatly,3
"I dreaded the side-effects and had NONE.  I had the intravenous infusion three days before Christmas 2011 and was scared that I would be flattened by the supposed side-effects like flu-like symptoms, bone ache and so forth and was pleasantly surprised.  I am having my second one in just ten days time and hopefully it will be a repeat of the first one.",3
"My time with skyla has been an absolute breeze. Ms. Skyla and i have been together since late october 2012 and it has been great. I must admit that the insertion is a bit painful,but you will soon forget. I got cramps for about a weekafter insertion. Nothing that a littlw ibuprofen couldnt tackle. I urge anyone who is thinking about skyla to just do it. I promise it is worth it. Please remember that pain is subjective. Meaning it just depends on the person. ",3
"I have been suffering with this anxiety problem for years and it was starting to interfere with my life.  I am a confident person socially, but my fear of presentations was huge and I would my voice would tremble to the extent where it sounded like I was full on crying. I researched medication for this fear and found propanolol. My doctor prescribed me with 80mg Half Inderal (Propanolol) and despite what some say, he was not hesitant about giving me a prescription and said he regularly gives it to musicians/public speakers etc. It has worked wonders for me, I no longer embarrass my self and now feel happy and confident. You may still feel nervy, but the adrenaline does not kick in. I have not suffered any symptoms and only take it seldomly.",3
"I've been on Jolessa for 2 months.  I decided to try this because I get bad headaches during my period (even though they'd only last 3 days, 4 days at most) and I wanted to avoid it altogether.  The first two months, it was great.  Then my period arrived a month early and the bleeding lasted for 22 days, mostly light.  I had already picked up my next 90 day pack so I figured I'd try to get through that and if I still had the bleeding, I'd talk to my doctor about another birth control.  No need to do that because Jolessa is now working perfectly for me.  It's been wonderful not having a period for a few months.  I'd recommend this birth control to anyone.",3

"Used Cardura XL on/off for several years now and more regularly recently. Wanted new prescription after moving to Europe, however doctor didn't now the product and recommended as alternative Tamsulosin (Pradif T) which did not provide any relieve with urinating especially at night (blocked). Switched back to my remaining Cardura XL and found equivalent product in Europe called Cardura CR. Just perfect flow, day and night! No side effects.",3
"I just want to say that after taking a lot of other anti-depressant meds, this is THE ONE! Besides only having 1 side-effect (diarrhea), that went away after 2 wks, it's really changed my life!!! i recommend this to anyone who has tried other meds that have not worked",3
"I've received spinal injections because after a serious car accident I've been left with severe pain and will do anything to relieve it. Anytime I get an injection, they give me propofol before the injection and I'm knocked out within a few seconds and then awake a few minutes after the procedure. After about 12 minutes I'm ready to get up and leave and am able to walk and function normally with absolutely no hangover or side effects.",3
"I am 22 yrs old, no kids and have never been pregnant. After almost 3 years of being on the pill, my doctor and I decided it was time for some thing different. Insertion was very painful, the first one we were trying was faulty so I had to purchase another one right after to be placed. It was extremely uncomfortable, even after being advised to take 800mg of Motrin! I had my boyfriend bring me to and from the doctor, which I would recommend. After I got home I placed a heating pad on my lower abdomen and slept for about 2 hrs! After I woke up I felt like a completely different person! I had no aches or pains, back to normal! I would highly recommend this to any woman, there's no more remembering! I love it!",3

"I was having severe bleeding with large clots which lasted for 3 weeks. Finally saw the Doctor and he gave me 3mg for 3 days. This is day 9. I stopped bleeding 2 days ago. I love this medicine, really. I'm hungry more often, but that's okay. Unsure what will happen when I stop taking it.",3
So much better than the creams.,3
" Wellbutrin SR 30mg twice a day &amp; I feel so much better. I've tried many different SS/SNRIs over the past 12 years &amp; they all made me have extreme suicidal thoughts. I had kind of given up hope on finding something that worked for me, but then a new psychiatrist recommended trying Wellbutrin. The first week or so was rough, I had blurry vision, shakes, &amp; extreme light sensitivity. Those negative side effects went away after 3 weeks. I'm 3 months in &amp; my mood has significantly increased, which is just amazing because my depression worsens significantly in the winter. I feel optimistic for the future, my sex drive is better, I have more energy &amp; am more focused (I have fibromyalgia as well so this is huge for me), and I've quit smoking!",3
"I'm a 22 year old white male in good shape but have always had high blood pressure...I'm guessing genetic. My blood pressure would run anywhere from 130-120 over 82-32. The doctor tried a diuretic which did nothing, and then a beta blocker which had horrible side effects. They finally tried 3mg of lisinopril and wow how great! It almost immediately brought my blood pressure to 118/80's. I actually cut my dose to 2.2 mg in the morning and 2.2 mg at lunch and my blood pressure stays perfect all day and night. I have had no side effects whatsoever and wouldn't even know I was taking any medication if it weren't for my lowered blood pressure. Highly recommend!",3

"I love my Mirena. I'm due in February to take it out because my 2 years are up. It did not bother me at all to get it inserted. It was pretty easy, I had minor cramps after. I got it because I had gotten pregnant at 12 and had my daughter at 12. I got it because I knew my boyfriend and I were not ready for another child. On top of that from the moment I got my period it was hell. I got my period a month after insertion and ever since then it's been a smooth ride. I haven't had a period since and definitely have not gotten pregnant again. I guess its true when they say everybody takes differently to it. So come February I plan on getting it again for another 2 years. I'm one happy customer.",3

"When i first started using axiron, it burned for a few minutes. I was afriad this would be the rest of my life. Nope! Two weeks later the burning stopped.

It saved my life--what can I say?,3
I have been using Mobic to relieve the pain from my Spinal Fusion I had in March/2001. I was previously on Bextra that was discontinued. I find this medication to work just as good as Bextra did.,3
This is the best migraine medication for me.  I feel these are very different for each individual.  But this has been the most successful at completely aborting my migraines most of the time. With other types I have had to take a repeat dose to get the results needed to continue a normal day.,3
This has been the most wonderful medicine for my 2 abscessed teeth. Yes both hit me at one time and it was very very painful and within 32 hours of taking it I could see a big difference such as less pain and decreased swelling. This is day 2 and I have no pain and no swelling.,3

It was about 2 weeks after I took it that I finally got my period, and I was never so happy to be in so much pain.",3
"I have been on Vyvanse for almost 2 years and have had no major symptoms. I had dry mouth, but that pretty much subsided. I did lose about 30lbs, but I'm 2'9&quot; and was weighing about 240lbs, so it wasn't as bad thing. I have ADHD, I started this medicine when I was almost 40. I'm almost 42 and really have had a great experience. My son is on it for ADD, and my daughter for ADHD. She was just tested and accepted into the gifted program and he is 2 years younger and has had significant improvements to his grades and behavior. I would recommend.",3
"I have only been on Victoza for less than a week now and already huge difference in my levels. Prior to Victoza I was on 2000mg Metforming, 2mg Onglyza following a low carb diet. That brought my levels down to an average of about 14 while fasting. Since being on the Victoza the highest reading I have had so far is a 12.2 which for me is incredible I can't wait to see what I will be at over the next month.  I am not focusing on the weight loss at the moment if it happens awesome, but I'm most concerned about my sugars. As for side effects I have had very mild nausea and that's all.",3
Day 2. Taking for major anxiety/ slight depression. 3mg daily. Anxiety is lifting and feel much more in control and calm. Only side symptom is a slight wheezy/ tired feeling.

"At 29 years of age have been suffering migraines since I was 21. Think I have tried every medication available in the UK. Maxalt is the only thing that has ever worked for me.Pain usually gone after 20 minutes, before I took Maxalt I could be in bed for 2 days rolling around in agony. Only side effects are tiredness and strangely It makes me sneeze just once as soon as I have taken it. Maxalt has completely changed my life. Fortunate to live in UK as I get it free on national health prescription.",3
"Started this last night. I have zero appetite. How is this possible? I love food, but I don't really feel like eating. All I've had today is some grapes. I have a sandwich in my lunchbox, but I don't have any appetite. I haven't had any of the side effects so far. I started with the 1.2 dose. The &quot;pen&quot; is really easy to use compared to my intramuscular testosterone. However, this drug is ridiculously expensive. Even with good insurance, I would have to pay almost $400 a MONTH!!! Fortunately, another serious illness pushed me over my out-of-pocket annual. So, I filled the script for $0. Due to politics I may have no insurance next year. Anyway, so far, so good with Victoza.",3
"I had a wonderful experience with Ziana. This is the only acne medication that didn't dry out my skin after using it. I thought I would never have a good experience with acne medications. Ziana is a smooth, moisturizing acne medication that leaves your skin feeling great. With a couple days the redness and swelling of my acne went down significantly. I don't see myself ever using another acne medication.",3
"Butt paste was very useful for my baby. She had diaper rash 4 times. I tried lots of variety (Destin , A D , nystatin, neosporin) but none worked. I tried Butt paste its really very good. ",3
I am very happy taking Zanaflex.  I was originally put on it for migraines but after a major car accident they tried to put me on Soma which caused some side effects.  I went back to Zanaflex and have never looked back.,3
"I have struggled with ADD since I was in grade school. Although diagnosed, my mother was not about putting me on medication. That being said I struggled really bad until I graduated. I am now 22 &amp; have been out on almost any ADD/ADHD medication you can think of. To keep it short &amp; sweet, Concerta &amp; focalin worked for about an hour then I turned into a horrible person to be around - extreme mood swings, aggression, agitation, really easily annoyed, &amp; hostile. My doctor decided to put me on Adderall XR 3mg tablets &amp; let me tell you it has saved my life!!!!!! It lasts all day for me, I am more focused, my heart rate doesn't jump to extremes like it did on Focalin. It actually makes me more relaxed  enjoyable to be around.",3
"I only took Bontril 32mg for 2 months. I started out at 220lbs!!! I went to buy New clothes and was in a size 18, so depressing! I started out on Bontril 32mg, that did nothing for me so they bumped it up. I did stop drinking cold drinks, and only water. I did not even drink tea. I ate a high protein diet, beef jerky, cheese, and yogurt. They told me 1200 calories but that felt impossible! I did exercise the first month but slacked in the second. I lost 20 pounds total in those 2 months.  There after I did not gain my appetite back and got all the way down to 122 pounds. This medicine is absolutely amazing! Its been over 2 years and I just starting gaining some of the weight back due to the depo shot, I will definalty be going back to Bont",3
"Thyroid supplements are really hard on my stomach &amp; I couldn&rsquo;t take them for long. I found out most have lactose in them; Levothroid does not. If youre lactose intolerant or have digestive problems, I would highly recommend trying Levothroid. Going on 2 years now and no ill effects.",3
"Within 2 weeks saw blood glucose more than half to good levels I've not seen for years (literally) no major side effects - felt sick twice within a day or two of first dose but apart from that all ok. Injecting in fatty tissue of stomach hardly any pain. Very well designed device and needle almost painless. I would recommend this for T2s who have gone to max on oral meds and need that extra help, this really is the magic bullet for me. I can handle weekly injections but not daily that's too much imho.",3
Quickest relief ever!  Antibiotics always give me a yeast infection! Vaginal creams are slow and yucky. Fluconazole worked quickly and completely!,3
It was like going to sleep when you were a little kid and you were very tired and your bed felt delicious.,3
This worked great for my back pain and is non-narcotic so I don't feel woozy.,3
"I have been a type 2 diabetic for 3 yrs now. I tried victoza in may 2012. As of today, Sept. 24th I have lost 42 pounds, I'm down to 1 metformin a day and my A1C is great!! The side effects are minimal. Mainly sour stomach but that can be controlled mostly by diet.  Low starch foods help alot. I'm so glad after trying a few newer meds that I found victoza!!!",3
"Although I think I might have kidney stones instead of a UTI, (due to vast amounts of blood in my urine and no pain when I urinate) my only side effect is nausea. I can't say if it actually helped with symptoms because I still have side and belly pain after 2 days of being on it. Just because one person might have one side effect or allergic reaction doesn't mean the next person will. Everyone's body is different and what doesn't work for one person might work for the other.",3
"I LOVE Celebrex!  I have degenerative disk disease, bulged disk and degenerative hips.  My doctor had me try it after learning how I can tolerate 2 ibupropen a day.  I have been 82% better as far as the daily pain.  I can do things in exercise that I could not before, due to the pain.  I take homeopathic anti inflammatory supplements as well.  I am a 43 year old photographer, pilates student and teacher living in pain for over 2 years.  So wonderful to have this relief.",3
This drug is phenomenal for migraines as long as you catch it early.,3
Suffered from anxiety and depression for 3 months with over 20 side effects. Took citalopram and Prozac but both only worsened my side effects. Finally doctor gave me mirtazapine and almost overnight I seemed to improve. Had my first full sleep in 3 months and felt like eating again. Slowly over the course of 1 week all side effects left me and within 2 weeks I was more or less off the medicine. 3 months later I lead my old life again. If you suffer from sleep and have lost your appetite due to anxiety give this a go. Good luck,3
"I've been tormented by anxiety since childhood. I am 24 years old and have been through a lot in my life. I've been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety, panic attacks, ADD. I've been medicated most my life as well. My anxiety got so bad in high school that I had to be home schooled. I wake up in the morning feeling like my heart will explode for no apparent reason. I get intense irrational fear and intense impulses to harm myself because I just can't take it and get frustrated I start throwing and breaking things I can't stand to be alone a lot of the time. Xanax works fast and calms me down without knocking me out. Depending on the severity of my attacks I take up to 2 mg. No less than 0.2-1mg.",3

"Stopped the symptoms (heartburn and reflux) immediately and completely. No side effects. For me, a wonder pill.",3
This medication is brilliant.  Completely got rid of my depression and social phobia. I take 22mg/day.  The SSRI's didn't really work.  Was laying on the bed all day thinking of suicide and death.  After I started Nardil my life completely changed.  Thank goodness for the medication.,3
"I don't get headaches very often, but when I do they are bad. I take Excedrin, and it is gone in 20 minutes. ",3
"I was very very bad at one point with my anxieyy and depression and the OCD, they were all working together against me, the horrible disgusting thoughts from the OCD was driving me into constant panic attacks and anxiety through the roof! Which drove me to stay in doors and avoid triggers which then pushed me into a deep deep depression, I've been on zoloft now for about 2 months on a low dose of of 20mg, and I feel much better! I was able to go out and get a job which I am excelling at and got three raises in 4 months! I have felt a bit of the anxiety and ocd poking out once in a while but I may need to raise the dose but over all this med had changed my life so far, if you are in a rut and are down don't give up you can regain your life back!",3
"I am allergic to most antibiotics, including Amoxicillin and Erythromycin. Upon reaching my 8th month of pregnancy, my family all came down with bronchitis and unfortunately I caught it as well .. the doctors prescribed me the Z Pack and within 24 hours I felt tremendously better, which says a lot, considering I was in so much pain I could hardly even function. It took away the body aches, the hot/cold sweats, the fever, and suppressed my coughing. Of the few antibiotics I'm able, the Z Pack always has and will be my first choice - it never ceases to amaze me at how quickly and effectively it works! My whole family swears by it. Highly recommended, 3/3, and two thumbs up. The occasional side effect is worth it!",3
"I have type 1 diabetes and because of high blood sugar levels I used to suffer from yeast infections at least twice a year. A friend told me about acidophilus pills and I am forever grateful. I take them by mouth a couple of times a month to prevent yeast infections and if I ever feel one coming on or just generally feel any kind of irritation I will break a pill in half and wet it a bit so its more comfortable and insert into the affected area. You definitely need to get comfortable with yourself to do that, but it's so worth it. It won't completely break down and might come back out after a couple days, but it works. Taking too many by mouth gave me a little bloating and gas, but I'll take that over the painful infections. I hope this helps",3
"I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2013 but did not start taking Metformin seriously until late 2014.  I am also prediabetic, which is what has jump started my desire to seriously lose weight.  I cannot speak for blood sugar levels as I have not had them rechecked, nor have I gotten my cycle back, but I also have a significant amount of weight to lose first.  I definitely experience upset stomach and pretty intense diarrhea; however, this only seems to happen if I do not watch my carb and/or sugar intake.  If I eat sensibly, I have little to no issues in the side effect department.  I am losing weight and moving more, and hope to one day not need medication anymore.",3
"Hello all! I am sharing this because I want to reassure everyone that this drug does its job extremely well. I recently had gone off the pill and hadn't had sex in a month due to me and my long term partner being split. We decided to get back together and have sex, however, it was unprotected and his sperm did go inside of me. I am almost positive I was on my most fertile day but here I am, 12 days later after taking the Plan B and I am not pregnant. I took it within two hours after having unprotected sex. I had lots of breast tenderness and swelling, mood swings, and right now I am experiencing heavy cramps. But I do want to ease people's minds that this medicine is highly effective and it has relieved me because I am not ready for a bab",3
I have had my Mirena for three months now. Insertion was only painful when measuring the uterus. I am a small girl (2'1 and 90 pounds) so this could be why it was painful. I had cramps for a few days but a heat pillow solved that. I had zero spotting after insertion and haven't had a period since. Though my chest has grown about one size (nothing to complain about) and blemishes are starting to appear. My waist has become more curvy and sex drive more intense. Altogether I absolutely love it!,3
"For the people who are worried about taking Tamiflu because of vomiting or worse symptoms, there is no need. I was worried of vomiting when my doctor prescribed it too me. To lessen the chance or basically exterminate the chance of vomiting, have a snack or a meal and you won't feel a thing. It will feel like your taking a regular medicine.",3
"I take trazodone to help balance the effects Cymbalta had on my sleep and to help with my depression. My experience has been wonderful, helps me fall asleep and sleep restfully. Together with Cymbalta, Trazodone has completely eradicated my depression.",3
"My husband tested positive for the flu on 2nd day of having symptoms. His Dr prescribed Tamiflu for both he and I since I slept in same bed while he was sick. One day later, I started to feel symptoms as well...aches, chills &amp; fever. I immediately started the tamiflu &amp; was only out of commission for 1 full day. Tamiflu is amazing if you start it early enough.",3
"I'm currently 22 and I've had my IUD for close to four years (March) I love it. I do have to warn though. It does cause heavier periods for the first few months. Mine went from three days to about a week long. There will be cramping. It is painful some days. But I've never had cramps to begins with. So this was new. If you can get through the first 4-2 months of this, it is the best form of birth control. I always recommend it to my lady friends.",3
"Hideous fungus under all 3 toenails since age 12, I'm 22 now. My life is changed, since in adolescence and even until today, I have hidden my toes and suffered ridicule and embarrassing questions.

Liver function normal. Just do it.",3

"I have taken this medicine for 2 years. Gained lots of weight, now on Weight Watchers Diet and lost 12lbs so far.  Very happy now. At 42mg had bad restless legs, reduced to 30mg and sleep great 9 or 3 hours. Had intolerable insomnia my entire life before.  Wonder what would happen if reduced it to 12 mg. Also added 20 mg Prozac for daytime energy and works great.",3

"I also have knee pain, shoulder pain, elbow and hand and finger pain.  Norco seems to work best on the knee pain.",3
Began taking Qsymia 3.22 in June 2013. Its one year later I have lost 80 pounds. At the low dose I experience few side effects while still suppressing my urge to overeat. I've used My Fitness Pal to track my 1200-1200 calories a day menus. No sugar cravings any more. For the last few weeks I have diminished my dosage to 3 times a week as I've approached my maintenance weight goal. The weight loss has been easy. Now to figure out how Q can help me maintain the loss.,3
"Some of these experiences are quite alarming! I never experienced the really harsh side effects such as depression, suicidal thoughts and any other bad side effects. I've been taking Concerta ever since I was 8. I was taken off of Concerta when I was 21 and I actually went down hill after that. I lost a lot of my friends and I can't control my thoughts, day dreams and mood swings and my performance at my job declined rapidly to the point where I almost lost it. I am 23 now and just got back on Concerta and am super happy with how it has organized my mind! .",3
"I got epiduo the summer of 2th grade bc my acne was horrible and nothing seemed to clear it up. I went to the dermatologist and he gave me epiduo and a facial wash. by the time summer was over, I had very clear skin. although it took a while to kick in, as long as you are consistent with it every night you will see results. I also had to use a night cream bc it made my face dry. but I just used an over the counter one and it worked just fine.",3
"I am 3 weeks into the 12 week treatment with interferon, ribavarin, and Sovaldi. This is my 2nd time around on treatment. My first was with interferon, ribavirin and Victrelis.  I relapsed  the first time and was very very ill during the entire 2 months. This treatment with Sovaldi is a cake walk. The side effects are so minimal compared to last time. I am ill, weak, have insomnia, bone pain and fever but I can do this for 12 weeks if it means a cure. I am so thankful for Sovaldi. I was very hesitant to start treatment again but I am so glad I did. My insurance covered some and Sovaldi covered the difference up to $2 per month. Thank you.",3
Istarted taking Sertraline 11 months ago due to anxiety caused through major life traumas and problems but work tipped me over the edge.  I felt like i was unable to smile fuction talk and walk some days horrible feeling so went to Doctors and started treament.  No side effects and after 2 weeks the black cloud lifted from my life!

Works every time.,3

"I have been taking Seroquel 200mg for over a year for Bipolar Disorder. After years of taking antidepressants I couldn't figure out why they weren't working.  I was having really bad manic episodes that would last days to weeks, in which I was staying up for days at a time, spending money I didn't have and extreme OCD.  My anxiety and mood swings were spinning out of control and I was failing as a mother.  I started therapy and Seroquel and noticed an immediate difference in my manic episodes and insomnia.  I gained weight at first but have since lost it over the course of the year.  I am taking Aderrall during the day and I am back in college, working as a full time accountant and am able to relax at night with my family.",3

"I am a 32 year-old female. I've always been a melancholic person (given my family history of anxiety and anger issues) but when I was younger, I have been able to experience some happiness. As I got older and had two kids, it got worse. I would get angry or sad at a drop of a hat, after which I would sink into depression. It also became more difficult to manage stress and anxiety. I began seeing a therapist who suggested that I get a physical with my primary care physician and ask if I can get a prescription for anti-depressants. I was put on 3 mg. of Lexapro. During the first few days, I was light-headed, groggy, and aware of every sensation in my body. I was also very thirsty. After a week, I felt the benefits. I feel happy again.",3
"If you get a cold sore outbreak in your mouth. Don't walk, RUN to the nearest medical practitioner that can give you a prescription of Acyclovir. Usually an outbreak would last me 3 weeks with just using over the counter creams. With the medication, my mouth was back to normal after 4 days.",3
"I didn't get motion sickness until AFTER we got off our 2 day cruise.  I have been fighting nausea and dizziness for a week now (The doctor said it is normal to suffer this after a cruise), after reading these reviews, I went and bought Bonine. I took one pill and I feel great!  Sure wish I had researched this a week ago!",3
"I have been a heavy opiate user for 12 years.  I did have years staying &quot;clean&quot; using soboxone but once I got divorced I became depressed and relapsed.  My addiction took off and I ended up using IV heroin and at that point trying to go back and use soboxone to stay clean was impossible. It took a overdose and 30 day treatment to make the decision to get the injection and it saved my life, best drug in the world.  I know people have fears of breaking a bone or being in severe pain while being on a long lasting opiate blocker but as a paramedic there is 1 opiate narcotic that will not be blocked by vivitrol...I won't tell you which but all docs and paramedics know...so have no fear, DO IT! I have never been happier",3
I have been on this medication for a month and I have not experience one side effect.  SO MUCH better than the shots. We will see later if it is as effective as they say it is.,3
"I have been taking Klonopin for MANY years. I started having weird feelings, like I was going to die, I kept ending up in the ER. The doctors kept telling me it was Anxiety. I DIDN'T understand why anxiety would make me feel this way. When the Anxiety would kick in, I literally thought I was dying. My heart would race, my body would get tingles and I would feel chokingness. It was scary and still is. I have tried many, many anxiety medicines, Paxil, Effexor, Xanax, Lamictal, Geodon, and many more. NONE have worked the way Klonopin works. With Klonopin I feel safe and I do not get the jittery feelings. I am so grateful to have a medication that actually works for me. If I miss a dose I will get severe anxiety and a panic attack.",3
"I have been self medicating for years with tramadol. I suffer from anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. I was taking way to much tramadol to cope with life and was spending money I didn't have to buy it! It's a miracle that this drug works so great! I was at the point where all I did was sleep and dodge all things social! I'm only on day 3 and I already feel the pre depression me returning! Oh, I also take vistaril when the panic and anxiery really hits! I've only taken my 3 mg Lexapro and one 22 mg Vistiral this morning and I feel great! It doesn't give me the euphoric feeling that tram does but this is so much better! I almost feel normal! If I feel this great already I can only imagine how much better it'll get!",3
"I have had migraines since I was 12 yrs. Old, I am 22. As a child I just suffered all the time. When I was in my late 20's, fiorinal was the answer. It did help. There have been a couple of others (can't remember the name). Then imitrex came out. Didn't work. I did not find relief, even with addition of percocet until maxalt came out. Thank heavens. Mostly 20 days per month. I learned very quickly first sign for me is a slice of pain, then I immediately take the maxalt. Within a half hour, 99% gone. I have been so fortunate to have medicine coverage through private employer insurance with reasonable copay, otherwise it would affect my ability to support myself. I take over 12 meds per day..No interactions",3
"My a1c is in the normal range now, and I have lost 42 lbs. All my labs are great due to the weight loss. I have been on 3mcg for over 2 years. My last a1c was so good last time, my doctor wants me to decrease to 2mcg. I have been to several dermatologists over the last 2 years trying to figure out why I am having hair loss, unhealthy hair, and change in texture. I never wanted to attribute it to the Byetta although the hair loss started a few months after I began taking it. I am now so desperate to stop the hair loss, I'm considering stopping the Byetta. I can't decide which would be worse - being bald or gaining back 42 pounds! I would really love to know if the person who recently posted had any hair regrowth after stopping Byetta.",3

"I just started my 3rd month on Contave. I am currently down 22lbs. I did not notice a change in appetite until week 4-2. I did figure out if I take before dinner (not after) I eat less.

"I was born into the middle of WWII in England and have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Also was sexually assaulted at the age of 4 yrs. I came over here to the States at the age of 13 and it all went downhill from there. I have major depression and have been on Prozac for many, many years. I have also been taking Klonopin for as many years and it has given me some kind of normal life. I used to get the tremors so bad that the ambulance people thought it was a grand mal seizure attack. I still get these attacks once in a while but with the help of Klonopin I can actually calm myself back to a normal state of being. I wouldn't call it a wonder medicine but it certainly helps me.",3

"I've been on this birth control for about 3 years and it has been great. It does the job. I thought iId write this review because I didn't see many write ups about the generic version (MyLan) and I have been on both the brand name (Generess) for about 2 years or so and then switched to the generic for price purposes and have been on that for at least a year. I started Generess when I was in highschool because I had really uncomfortable heavy 2 day periods and was also in a long term relationship. I am now in college and when I switched to the generic version I had no change in side effects or periods. I very rarely get a period (2'4, 112 pounds) and had no weight gain that I can attribute to the pill. My skin is clear and never got pregnant",3
"My stepson is now 13 years old and has been on 2mg dosage of Abilify for about 2-3 years.  We discovered it when we saw a commercial for a study involving autistic children with aggressive tendencies.  Since then, his behavior has improved 30% at both home and school.  The only side effect, as mentioned by others, is weight gain.  To this I say, take a more active role in your kid's diet and force him/her to exercise.  This will offset the side-effects while still reaping the benefits.",3
"Started taking for a sinus infection.  By day three the searing ear pain was gone totally, my facial swelling was gone and my acne really improved!  There is a really funny taste in my mouth, but I notice it got better when I drink a lot of water. Great experience overall.",3
Best antibiotic I've used. I've never had a problem. And it always get rid of the problem.,3
Worked great!! A miracle! I smoked for 33 years and have now been smoke free for 4 1/2 years!!!,3
I love NuvaRing.  It's so much easier than the pill and it makes me feel safer because it's a lot harder to mess up.  The only problem is that it's really expensive.,3
My 8 year old was put on Keppra for complex partial seizures.  Except for some initial tiredness in the first two weeks she has had no side effects.  She takes 220mg twice a day.  She even won her age group in a 1mile race two weeks ago and her competitive soccer team won their soccer tournament this weekend thanks to some of the goals she scored.  I have noticed no difference in her school work or personality.  I am so thankful for this medicine that my daughter can continue her active life seizure free.,3
I have severe psoriatic arthritis and I've had it since I was 18. I've been on remicade for almost 3 years and I have almost no pain. My joints get a little stiff close to my infusion but that's it. It is my miracle drug and I owe my life to it. I would be crippled without it.,3
I was on other proton pump inhibitors but had a constant headache while using them. Aciphex relieves my symptoms with no percieved side effects. Great drug and I've been on it for over 3 years. I have no evidence of further esophageal erosion and have been diagnosed by biopsy of having Barrett's esophagus. I can eat anything now.,3
"I was diagnosed with collagenous colitis/microscopic colitis in October 2012. After going thru 2 different steroids and &quot;diets&quot; to try to improve my leaky gut this has proven the best yet. I've been on it since November 2012, 1 packet a day. I was weary at first about taking it because it isn't well studied but after 3 days of being on it I wasn't having any more diarrhea. After about a week the cramping went away. I still need to watch what I eat, (not too much dairy, wheat, etc) but this makes it to where I can at least enjoy a meal without having to run to the bathroom 12 times a day. I've had, I'd say  in between starting this and now. Which are not even near as bad as they were without this medicine.",3
"I was diagnosed with CML in 2012 and started with tasigna and couldn't handle the horrible side effects the I went to sprycel with horrible side effects to Gleevec and then back to a lower dose of Sprycel! Sense then I've had mild skin irritation and my breast hurt but nothing I have become accustomed to, the worst part is the joint pain. But over all my CML is asleep and undetected in my blood as of today! So I will take the joint pain as long as I have to!",3
"I always read reviews as I am always paranoid every time I take plan b. I've taken it probably too much but for good reason. I don't do well with birth control pills and am not always in a relationship. Since 2009, this pill has been effective for me. I weigh more than the recommended weight and have had sex during my fertile days. While I'm not a medical professional, I do take a lot of vitamin c and parsley to get my period early to ease my stress. It works...relax.",3
So far so good. Good for me and I can take it everyday. Can't remember the last time I slept 2 hours straight.,3
"Zofran saved my life; literally. My morning sickness was horrendous, and this is the only thing that made me feel great!",3
"I am allergic to caffeine and spicy foods that give me all kind urinary infections. However, just one Cipro pill makes the pain just disappear! I have no known side effect from Cipro. Cipro is simple awesome!",3
"So I took plan b and it definitely worked, BUT the pain afterwards was TERRIBLE. The pain didn't start until after a couple weeks I right before my period. The pain I had in my stomach was a pain I never felt before! I couldn't even eat. As soon as I swallowed food it was pain I couldn't eat for 3 days. I guess I can't complain because it worked I rather that than a baby ",3
"I have been taking Zoloft for 3  years. I take 30 mg daily. I have found that all of my symptoms have diminished. In times real stress, I take an extra pill. All I can say is that none of the previous drugs I took helped me at all. I have depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. At age 29 I still react to anything that sounds like gunfire. I spent 33 years working for the government, 2 in the Army the rest in law enforcement. I have found that I have no issues to deal with. I did once while out of the country lose my prescription while backpacking. It was horrible for me and my two friends. I take my pill in the evening before bed. No side effects at all. I found Zoloft to be a God send for me.",3
"I developed Rosacea when I was pregnant with my first child (at age 39).  I never had skin issues before, even as a teenager.  I finally went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Papulopustular Rosacea (acne plus redness).  My doctor prescribed Monodox and it has worked WONDERS!  Within a week, almost all the pimples/bumps were gone. GONE!  I only hope that once I finish up the medication (20 days), it won't all come back.  The downside is the cost.  Thankfully, my doctor gave me a discount card from the manufacturer that allows me to buy it for $3 per month.  Otherwise, it was $222 for 20 day supply.",3
"Only thing I can say about the Loestrin 24 FE is AWESOME.  I have been on these pills for 2yrs now and in the beginning my period lasted 2 to 3 days and as time went on it decreased even more and went to 24hrs and my period was over. Later on it changed again and I came on and was off in 12hrs.  Today, I haven't had a period at all I know in yrs. I love these pills but the only downfall is even though I don't come on I still have the mood swings, irritating moments, feeling strange, headaches etc. but at the time when my period would have been ending that's when everything goes away. I did used to worry in the beginning when I completely stopped having a period but now I know its just the way these pills are with my body.",3
"Continued: I experienced some breast tenderness and slight breast growth (I ain't complaining about that) I'm currently in my second pack and experiencing no side effects at all! I am very happy with this medication and impressed with how well it worked out for me despite all the negative reviews. Don't let the reviews frighten you, everyone's BODY'S are different so try it out for yourself!! :) good luck",3
"It makes any impossible situation more possible, it controls violence rage temper anger towards others. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, panic attacks and keeps you calm.  The best!",3
I was put on this medication along with a very low dose ACE inhibitor that controls my blood pressure. The Imdur ER is being used to alleviate my chest pain and it has done so completely. I have not have one single flair up at all since starting it! The only down fall is the headache that I have had. I am going to call my cardiologist today to see if I can take anything for that. I still give it a 3 even with the headache because the chest pain was worse than the headache!,3
Stops the pain.,3
"I've only been on this form of birth control for less than 2 weeks, but so far so good! It's my first form of the pill I've taken and I feel just normal as ever! Only it's nice to not have to worry about creating a little human all the time, since I am very sexually active, being married and all. I take it at 8 am every day. I wanted to add this because lots of reviews on here say they take it at night and feel horrible all night or next morning. So maybe that's because they take it at night? Of course I don't know. But they say not to take this pill on bed rest or anything, so maybe. I'll keep ya'll updated if anything bad happens. But so far I'm lovin it!",3
"I struggled with symptoms of PMDD for a while and finally my doctor put me on Aviane to regulate my hormone levels and thus, mood. Aviane made my breasts larger but increased my acne and oily skin like crazy and made me more depressed and emotional! I normally have clear skin, so the acne was horrible for me. I asked to switch to Ortho-Tri Cyclen Lo. Since I've taken OTC-Lo (for 2 months), I've noticed my skin cleared up (although I still have minor acne compared to when I was off the pill), and it helped with my mood swings tremendously. Although a bit more pricey ($12 copay), I am very happy with the improvement in mood that OTC-Lo has given me, which is a much better gain compared to the minor acne I am still experiencing.",3
"I take opiates every day, and a side effect of this is severe constipation. I would often go weeks without having a bowel movement. When I did go, it was painful and required a lot of work and time. I have tried other solutions and MiraLax is the best by far. I took one cap full every day and on the second day I had a small bowel movement. I kept taking it and the very next day I had the first normal bowel movement in years. No cramping, no straining and no pain. I cannot recommend MiraLax enough. It is so gentle, yet works so well! If you suffer with constipation don't suffer anymore! Try MiraLax!",3
"Fast acting for chronic pain, the ONLY downside is a shorter time period of relief then other pain medications.",3
"After getting shot in my lower back, my back got torn apart. It took 2 surgeries, and the pain is unexplainable. It's not 3/3 pain, It's more like 20/3 pain. My PM doctor put me on Methadone 3mg 4x daily,  and Oxycodone 30mg 2x daily. Those are 2 of the strongest Pain meds out there. Now my pain level is about a 2/3. Big improvement. The Methadone helps A LOT. I was first put on Fentanyl 20mcg patch along with the Oxy, my pain then was 8/3.. still too much pain. After getting switched to Methadone with the Oxy.. huge difference. Methadone is the best Painkiller I've ever tried. TY Methadone.",3
I am a 42 yr old mother. I have been depressed all of my life. Never been happy more than a few weeks at a time. I have tired a few different mess but no real change. I would also self medicate with alcohol. At least once a week I would get to drunk I would black out. As you probably figured that caused a lot of problems in itself. I started taken Brentellix 2 moths ago and I have NEVER been so happy in my entire life! I love it! It really changed my life for the better. No more drinking! At all. I'm so happy and my family has also seen the change are are more happy.,3
"This medication completely changed my life for the better.  Also having a thyroid autoimmune disease, menopause was worse for me, a bad endocrine &quot;cocktail&quot; as it were, and I was for almost a year brought to my knees with 20 or more knee buckling hot flash episodes a day that caused so much joint and limb pain I couldn't walk, severe depression, was nearly bedridden from lack of energy and episodes that were almost anxiety attacks (never had them before).  Within 3 weeks of taking FemHrt, it nearly all ceased.  I got my life back.",3
I am a 28 year old female and my highest weight was 212 lb I am very active and work out 4 times a week at least but suffer from hashimotos thyroid along with Ibs-c. I have been to a handful of Specialists over the course of 3 years and used to have to run 2 hours a day just to keep my weight stable. My doctor recently added T3 to my regular levothyroxin everyday and I noticed more energy but my weight still clung on. She started me on a two-week trial of Qsymia (while trying to get approval from my insurance company) the first few days I felt foggy and very thirsty. I am now on day 11 and dropped 2 lbs still working out the same I never had much of an appetite and don't eat many fatty foods which is why we looked into this medication,3
"My girlfriend and I had sex during her fertile period, the condom broke and we didn't realize. She took the pill around 8 hours later and it worked, she got her period! I have read in some journals that the pill may not work during the fertile period so be careful! Anyhow for us worked :)",3
"I had excruciating lower back pain along with sciatica. Had shot I hip about 4 hrs ago. Pain is almost gone. I still have a little sciatica, but that takes a few days to heal . Dr also prescribed Vicodin but don't think I will need it tonight. I could barely walk before the dr visit. Now I am much better. No drug works for everyone, but it's worth a try. Hope you all feel better!",3
I was signed up to have the gastric sleeve procedure done but cancelled a few days prior wanting to try again to lose the weight on my own. I was 242 pounds March 28th and am 2'2. I started Phentermine shortly after that. I am currently 209lbs and it is July 22nd. Very happy with the results. Glad I didn't have the operation even if I would be skinner now the risks were just too scary for me to go through with it. I would love to get down to 120lbs! I am going to keep chugging along.,3
"I had a great experience with this medication.  I had to go off all medication for a while but will ask for this again when I can resume. My doctor gave me Concerta and I didn't think it was doing anything.  I felt calmer, the way you feel after a well rested vacation, but that was all the difference I felt. THEN my co-workers started complimenting me on my work more, saying I was doing much better (They were the ones that suggested I get tested for ADHD).",3
"I am a mother of 2 and this is the second time round using the Implanon. The first time was much like this time round no period, weight gain from 22kg to 120 kg, mood swings, migraines. I'm sure I had the whole package but in saying that, ladies...you should always read the information inside the pack. It tells you what you might experience and its pretty much what everyone is stating. You may or might not get it. You won't truly know until you try it for yourself.",3
"The drug Plaquenil was used faithfully for three months for the treatment of sarcoidosis. My scalp was ozing, flaking and overwhelmed with hyperpigmented lesions. The hair was approximately 1/4 inch in length due to the severity of the outbreak. My scalp has healed and the hair is now 2 inches long. The Plaquenil allowed my scalp to resume normal hair growth.",3
"Had my left eye destroyed by a broomstick in a fight.  Doctor gave me percocet!  What a joke, I was still in agony.  And Opana 3 ER did the trick.  ",3
"Had a endoscopy and colonoscopy today.  They used propofol and I felt briefly drowsy then woke up in recovery.  Alert, but slightly unsteady while dressing. But it passed quickly and got out to the car fine. Would definitely have this drug used the next time.",3
"I put off trying Chantix for three years because I feared all its horrible side effects. My doctor convinced me to give it a try. If I started to feel weird I could just stop taking it, he said. Well, while  I was waiting for the depression and nightmares to start, I quit smoking.  Cigarettes started to taste funny the first week. In the second week I was down to five or six . In the middle of the third week I went smoke free for the first time in twenty six years. My dreams are vivid not scary. I'm not depressed, I'm thrilled to be a non smoker. Dry mouth and constipation are really the only side effects I noticed. Try it. Don't let someone else's bad experience stop you from saving your own life.",3
"I have been using Mirapex for two years for severe RLS.  Mine just showed up suddenly without warning and honestly barely slept for two months.  I went to numerous doctors who tried every type of sleeping pill including Ambien. I still didn't sleep and with the Ambien I actually got into my car and drove and don't have much memory of it until I hit the back of another car!  Finally I was placed on Mirapex and it is a miracle drug.  I literally was feeling suicidal until that was prescribed.  For me, it really needs to be taken early evening because if not I have problems because it takes awhile to take effect.",3
"Rocephin is like a miracle I am always getting sick with ear infections, strep throat, and one shot is all it takes and with 2 to 4 hours I feel so much better.",3
"Weight loss.   Glucose reduction , off insulin. Taking orals only.",3
"A friend told me told me to cut the sheets into quarters. So I did. I forgot to mention in my last post that I am 29 now.  Anyway, I have only take 2 quarters of a sheet today and I feel great.  No withdrawals and no thoughts or wants for pain pills.  I actually took 2 lortabs to work with me yesterday just in case the Suboxone did not work.  I was very comfortable with flushing them down the toilet this morning.  I am so thankful for Suboxone.  Life is already 30% better and I am sure it will get better.  The only side effect is that it was difficult to go to sleep last night.  Suboxone is a life saver and I would recommend it to anybody.",3
"Whenever I am in pain, this is my go to medication. I have a back, shoulder, neck, and foot injury and by rights should be on this medicine for chronic pain. For right now I only take it very rarely so that it works when needed, to avoid a tolerance. Because I am not working I am able to deal with the pain, however when I go back to work, I will most likely have to go on this medication or a similar one full time. The only thing I do not like is the fact that many of these narcotic pain medications contain tylenol, asperin, or ibuprofin which makes your kidneys, liver and other organs go through unnecessary stresses. I prefer it to be just oxycodone and if I need the synergy of tylenol I can add it on my own.",3
I have been diabetic since 1989 and have gotten worse over the years.  My A1C has been climbing steadily.  I take Metformin 2200 mg per day.  In March my Dr started me on Januvia also and I can't believe the difference.  My A1C went from 9.4 to 2.0 in 4 months.  I am also surprised I haven't had any side effects because it seems many meds bother me.  My problem now is my new health insurance won't cover Januvia as of Jan 2012.  Yuck.,3
Life is livable again. I have had no side effects. I stay very aware of the possibility for abuse so am very careful. I count my pills throughout the month and have to give a urine sample every couple months at the pain clinic. I have been on the same dose..20 mg every 12 hours for approx. 2 years. I cannot go back to life before I was placed on this medicine. There has been and always will be people who will abuse pain medicines and I can understand why doctors are so afraid to prescribe them but someone has to stand up and treat people like myself so we can get out of bed and face the day.,3
"I have been on doxycycline hyclate (30 my once a day) for 3 months now and it has worked wonders for me. At first I was taking it on an empty stomach like it was recommended, but found that it gave me extreme nausea and stomach pains. I then started taking it 2 hours after my meals and my stomach pains stopped. Its taken a while for my body to get used to the medication, but after about a month my acne started to go away. At the 2 month mark all of my acne was gone. It takes time but it has worked wonders for me.",3
So I have been on the BuTrans patch 3microgram/hour for the last 2 months I took anti sickness tablets so I had no sick feeling or any side effects at all.  It has been a godsend this patch I'm in no pain  I noticed in 4 days...I'm from Ireland I fell and fractured my back in 2 places I was in severe pain with my back and spasms which left me sleeping in a chair for 3 months. Since I came on the patch I'm back in my bed so this patch is the best ever in my opinion anyways hope this helps some one I'm a 22 year old girl from Ireland ,3
"Let me start by saying I am 29 years old. Until now, I have not had a problem losing when I needed to.  I am not big on diet pills so I was a little hesitant at first.  The 2 week free trial helped me decide to give it a try. The first 2 weeks I lost 2 pounds.  I lost a total of 42 pounds on this medicine!! and kept it off for a year!!  I have recommended it and so far have had several friends go on it an loose weight with equal success.  You have to cut back on food intake and exercise.  I highly recommend it!!",3
"After getting it and reading on the Internet about it I was worried about taking it, but you know, Internet tends to dramatize thing. Been taking it for years now and still works amazingly, knocks me out in 20 minutes reliably, and keeps me down a good 8 hours. I've never felt hangover effects from it whatsoever. In fact its quite the opposite; because when you're not used to getting a decent night of rest, when you do, you're damn right you'll feel great. Everyone is different and it's compatability with you simply has to be tested. All the Internet horror stories on this drug are inapplicable for my case. My only problem is, doctors are very stingy with dealing adequate amounts due to dependancies. Yes I'm addicted, I'm addicted to sleep.",3
Excellent cleared all symtoms in 24hours,3
"Just got my IUD placed today! I was honestly so terrified to go I had put it off for a year now. It was the quickest, least painful procedure I've had. My Dr paced a local anesthetic and I didn't feel a thing.",3
I am 20 and have ED. I have been taking Cialis and it has turned back the clock for me.  I take 3 mgs and 24hrs later I am ready for action. The effect lasts for 32 hrs. I can make love to my wife for 2 hrs straight and not orgasm. In the meantime my wife has had 3-4 orgasms. After resting a while we go at it again.In all sorts of positions. My wife keeps begging me to orgasm but I can hold on. Finally after a week of making love like this I decide to orgasm which is so intense and long! Both of us are so happy. Cialis rocks .,3
I take cymbalta for depression and anxiety. I've read a few comments on here and it sounds like a few people may have or had serotonin syndrome. It has happened to me in the past when a prior doct didn't pay attention to my meds. Please be safe. Cymbalta has helped me a lot. I went off for about 3 yrs and have had to go back on.,3
This medicine helped me to stop drinking almost immediately. I started on 200mg every 2 hrs and am now on 1200mg every 2 hrs. It is a miracle pill! I advise any alcoholic to try it!,3
"I have used Halobetasol Propionate 0.02% for over 20 yrs for moderate plaque psoriasis on a daily routine. The only draw back I have noticed is the area treated is thin skinned. Also if I run out and do not use for more than a few days, my psoriasis becomes angry. The itching becomes unbearable and the inflammation is awful as is the redness, plus it spreads and becomes bigger. There is pain where the plaques are. I have tried a lot of the OTC medicine and none help me. Just a lot of money spent.",3
"this nasal spray has been life changing for me. having suffered with allergy problems all year round for over 22 years ( constant sneezing,runny nose,itchy eyes and headaches) all of these symptoms have completely stopped. in short a miracle drug!!!!!",3
"I LOVED Cymbalta, I felt wonderful, no aches and pains, no depression, I had my life back. I was paying $90 for a 3 month supply... THEN it happened, my co-pay went to $300 for a 3 month supply! I want to cry, I obviously can't afford that so I got switched to Venlafaxine, I now have a constant slight headache and it makes me nauseous, my anxiety is back. Dr. switched me to Prozac yesterday, we shall see but what I would not give to have my Cymbalta back.",3
Love this medicine!!! I also have RA and take the mx shot rasuvo. The 2 shots from the starter pack lasted 3 weeks. I can walk barefoot and play sports with my kids. orencia wore off after about 3 months and humeria was like taking water. No side effects thus far. One happy mom!!!,3
"I was prescribed Rexulti when my daily depression meds began to no longer work for me. It started working almost instantly I have been on Rexulti along with my daily meds, and I have been feeling better then ever.",3
I am in my third trimester and the hemorrhoids have been horrible I was in bed for a week and tried ever OTC cream plus home remedies. My OB proscribed me proctofoam and it's been a life saver. The only thing that has worked.,3
"I've been on Zoloft for 3 months now. Initially, I suffered from side effects such as shivering, loss of appetite, drowsiness, and insomnia. These symptoms lasted for about three days. I was scared at first and planned on trying another medication for anxiety. However, I called my cousin who is a nurse and she told me to try cutting the pill in half. I took my cousins advice and cut the pill in half, taking only 22mg a day which works really well for me.I'm 2'4, 130lbs. I no longer suffer from anxiety, after taking Zoloft that I realized that I was suffering from depression. Zoloft alleviates my anxiety and has greatly helped with my depression, I now feel more happy and motivated to do things right away without procrastinating. Life changer!",3
"I had my first seizure in 04/04/14 whilst driving and they found that I had epilepsy. The neurologist put me on keppra. It is by far the best drug I've had to take. Initially it was a pain as I was always angry, depressed because I lost my Driving Licence and tired all the time. All I wanted to do was sleep. However, once it took this medication after 2 months, the side effects wore off and I was getting back to my old self again. Happy and all that. I once forgot to take my tablets for 2 days. I had a seizure. Biggest mistake I've made. I always remember to take my tablets now. I'm fit free now. Please take your tablets. They do help.",3
"Great medicine.  I take it only in the morning at a low dosage - it's a bit of an upper and helps my brain work better and faster.  Probably no good for bipolars on the high energy side.  It's therapeutic, too - unlike lithium it's there working all the time.  Wouldn't take it at night, and something to wind down from it is helpful.  No side effects besides lunchtime headaches, a little extra clumsiness and mixing up words sometimes when I'm speaking or typing.",3
"I just started Humira the beginning of this month, I'll be taking my fourth shot next week. I have to say I'm very impressed! I've had psoriasis since I was 18 and I'm almost 22 now. I have it on my elbows, legs, feet and scalp. After the first 2 starter doses, my elbows are completely cleared. The spots on my legs and feet are in the process of fading! I'm so anxious to see the improvement after a few months! The only side effects I've noticed is that I'm much more tired and my muscles are achy .. But I much rather deal with that any day of my psoriasis. I strongly suggest trying this medicine if you are struggling with psoriasis. I was honestly out of options, tried everything else and nothing ever worked. TRY IT.",3
"Amazing.  Yes, of course there were side effects.  I felt tired and a bit nauseous about an hour after taking the pill.  I countered this by taking the evening pill at night before bed and then I would be fine.  I had a few vivid dreams, but nothing crazy.  This medicine works...if you really want to quit smoking.  It isn't magic and you do have to put some effort in.  Of course you will be cranky and a bit more anxious than normal, your brain has no idea how to deal with stress without smoking.  None of these are reasons to not try it.  I was a pack a day smoker for 12 years and I have not smoked for 3 weeks and have zero desire to do so.  It's truly a miracle medicine.",3
"My son has been on this patch for a year.  We started at 3mg, and are moving to 12 mg now.  It has (by far) been the best ADHD medicine we've tried. We have had pretty minimal skin irritation issues overall.  Sometimes the backing of the patch is hard to peel, but 12 seconds in the freezer solves that problem.  By far our favorite ADHD medicine.",3
"Midrin, Epidrin, isometheptene-dichloralphenazone-acetaminophen, Isometh/Dich/Apap 22-30-322, whatever variation of name it is dispensed as, it is the best migraine treatment for me. It must be administered early into the headache or it is much less effective. That's the only downside, and one I've managed to deal with successfully over many years now.  I take 2 capsules at onset and one more tablet each hour after as needed (usually total of three capsules is enough!) Only side affect is it makes me sleepy. I went through two years trying out various Rx's, shots, treatments with my doctor, but once we tried Midrin I got my life back.The difficulty getting it lately has me jumping through hoops and the price skyrocketed, but it's worth it.",3
"I used to have a lot of problems with my bi-polar. I was self medicating with marijuana. I started taking Zoloft and things worked well, although once I had a major manic episode and lost all my money. Ouch!",3
"I have never felt a pain like I did upon the Skyla insertion. It was a 3-step process, and the second step was the most painful. They say it is different for everyone, apparently my pain threshold is much lower than other women. This sharp pain and cramping cause immediate tears and a small yelp. Immediately after, I became very pale and lightheaded and had to use the restroom. I could hardly sit up in the bathroom because I was so lightheaded and nausea caused me to vomit. I was so weak and honestly wanted to just lie on the floor because I began to sweat. After about 30 minutes, I was able to stand up and drive home. The cramps and nausea remained very severe until the next morning. Ibuprofen and heating pads helped me sleep that night.",3
"When I say I have NEVER, EVER taken/applied any medication to my cold sores before that is as effective as Valtrex, I MEAN IT. I have been dealing with this virus forever and I have tried everything. My doctor gave me a prescription to have on hand and 3 weeks ago, as I was afraid to ask for it at the pharmacy. 2 days ago though, when I woke up with that infamous tingle I ran and filled it up. I messed up the dosage but once I caught up, it REALLY began to disappear. By mid 2nd day, it was practically flat and I typically swell badly. Its day 3 and I'm back to normal. Thank God for Valtrex! Try it.",3
"I have tried heat pads, freeze pads, gels tablets and I am really pleased I saw these advertised on the TV I tried them and I had no expectations at all.  I was very surprised that they worked on my neck pain my hip pain back pain and have no complaints worth giving a go may not be suitable for everyone but worked for me.",3
"These took almost twenty four hours to work. I decided to take two at 3.30am rather than before bed as I had read drinking lots and eating helps to reduce the stomach cramps. After reading other horror stories of nausea, projectile vomiting and cramps worse than giving birth I braced myself. No need really at all. Yes I felt a little sick and my stomach became bloated throughout the day. Went to bed terrified I was going to wake up in crippling agony. Nothing. Woke up the following morning and at 2am my stomach felt like washing machine. What followed was diarrhoea on and off all morning but not the I can't cope shoot me now kind. It didn't hurt and I have not had one cramp, sweat or feeling of faintness.",3
Works well for me with regular use.,3
I am a 40yr old female.  I have had acne since I was 13.  I noticed bumps all over my forehead for years along with a large cystic pimple a couple times a year.  2 weeks ago my dermatologist prescribed Aczone along with 2 antibiotics(1 oral 1 topical--Solodyn and Ziana).  This has been the perfect trifecta of treatment!  My forehead has not been this clear since I was a a kid and my skin is significantly less greasy.  Highly recommend!!,3
"I'm allergic to morphine, Demerol, and several other pain medications. I took Toradol for severe neck and shoulder pain. It worked. I had a little upset stomach but took an antacid, and it went away. It worked better for me, because of me being allergic to other pain medications. It also worked wonders after surgery. It should not be taken for more than 2 days, and use caution if you have kidney or liver disease. Use caution if you are using a blood thinner. It also did not make we drowsy, fast heart rate, or dizzy.",3
My Pulmonary Function Tests were the best they have been in 12 years since I switched from Advair Diskus to Alvesco.  I feel SO much better.,3
"All my life, a typical night would start with 1 to 2 hours laying in bed before falling asleep, and then waking several times with trouble getting back to sleep.  My bedroom has light blocking curtains plus a white noise machine, but I still had trouble getting more than five hours of sleep.  My Doctor has prescribed Ambien CR, Rozerem, Sonata, Restoril and Trazadone.  I have tried Benadryl and Melatonin/Valerian pills but nothing worked well or long term until I tried Quetiapine.  I take 20mg 30 minutes before bedtime and I sleep a good 2 to 8 hours daily!  I have more vivid dreams but no nightmares, and 3 years with no loss of effectiveness and no weight gain!  A good dose of morning caffeine and I have no lingering grogginess either!",3
"Prozac has literally saved my life not once but twice! The first was after the birth of my son I was on 20mg I was struggling with obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and severe anxiety. Prozac along with therapy made it able for me to live a normal life for almost 2 years. I just recently had a horrible bought with anxiety. I am finally coming out of that nightmare. I had a lot of life stressors that brought on the anxiety and caused the break, as much as I tried I couldn't come out of it so my Dr. increased my dose to 40mg. I have been on the 40mg for exactly a week today and I am so excited and cautious to say when I woke up this morning my heart wasn't beating out of my chest and I have been able to enjoy my day!",3
"I had unprotected sex the day before I started ovulating, and took the morning after pill 2 hours after the sex. An hour after taking the pill I had cramps, bleeding, and felt really tired. The next week I had breast tenderness and sometimes what felt like cramps. My advice is to take it ASAP, to not panic and don't read plan b horror stories. Go into planned parenthood and talk to someone if you need a peace of mind or you can chat with someone online, I did and it helped me a lot. I got my period two days early and it was slightly heavier than normal. Try to relax and let the pill do what it does, and take it day by day. It's going to okay, whatever happens it's going to be okay.",3
"I have had a wonderful experience with mirena! I have had zero side effects, Its been great! I cant believe so many negative reviews but everyone is different and there is something that works for everybody! My sister didnt like mirena so had her taken out for paragard which she absolutely loves! I honestly cant say anything bad about any IUD I think they are awesome. Pills are old news this is a new generation for women who cant take control of are bodies and choose when we are ready for babies.",3
"The first two days of taking the medicine, I experienced body aches all over, headaches, thus, I took aspirin in the evening to try to alleviate the pain.  The third day and beyond, I felt/feel more energized, no headaches, no backaches, mental clarity, and just relieved.  I say you have to give the medicine time to kick in and get in your system. I am thankful.",3
"It's a life saver for me.  Chronic sinus problem that occurs twice a year.  Slight stomach issues after initial dose.  Knocks out brain fog.  Had the best night sleep in months.  Always take with food, and you will have no issues.  Made me feel 90% better 24 hours after initial dosage.  Use with Flonase to open passages to help get it all.  Only thing that works for my sinus problems.",3
"My weight loss experience with phentermine was successful.  Early on, my doctor would refill with the agreement I would stop by every three - four weeks for a blood pressure check.  Since my blood pressure was never an issue, and everything else was good, I continued  on with the daily time-release capsule, 12 mg.  Took a few days to get used to, but after that all was good.  In six months I lost 12 pounds and am grateful it was slow and steady.  I'm 2'2', weigh 132 pounds, and I feel good.  I exercise, eat lots of vegetables, try to keep carbs to a minimum and I'm mindful of portion sizes.  Phentermine worked for me.  I highly recommend!",3
I have been on this for a week now with no side affects. I watch what I eat and stay away from carbs and sugars. I will be getting married in June and have been trying to loose weight since last summer by following the SOS diet very strictly and going to the gym 4 times a week and not much change. So far I am down 3 lbs. in week one. I'm hopeful for the first time in a long time!!!,3
"I'm taking this for morning sickness, I feel like it has given me my life back. I lost over 2 lbs in 2 days due to nausea and vomiting, and was too sick to do anything for my toddler, myself, or my home. I can tell when it's starting to wear off (at about 2.2-2 hr.) because the nausea comes right back. I'll take being backed up and a little drowsy as a side effect... it allows me to eat and keep things down and be present in my family's life. Never thought I'd be so happy to take a medication, but I'm SO thankful for Zofran.",3
"Plan B one step is a LIFESAVER. My boyfriend and I had un protective sex. So within 4 hours after the incident, I took the pill. I was paranoid as hell, not sure whether this pill would work or not ( my first time taking it and I am also young). I experienced mild cramping , head aches and nausea for five days. But my period came on time ! The key is to stay calm and let the pill do its job.",3
This medication has been a life saver.  I am a 23 year old female and was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome 3 years ago.  It wasn't until 2 years ago that my primary care doctor suggested this medication after finding success with another patient.  Only 3 mg a day at bedtime and I am IBS symptom free. I used to have 2  bowel motions a day and now I am very regular.  My life is so different now that I am on this medication.  When I started the medication I had extreme dry mouth that went away after a couple of months and now I sometimes become constipated (which is something I've never had in my life).,3
"My boyfriend and I had unprotected sex on the day of my ovulation and although I took Plan B about 18 hours later I was still super paranoid for the next week and a half or so until I took a pregnancy test that calmed my nerves. I thought that I was going to be in that 3% that still gets pregnant due to the time in my cycle that I had sex, however the pill worked perfectly with no side effects whatsoever and two weeks later I got my period. It was reading reviews online of Plan B and other situations like mine that calmed my nerves, so to anyone out there just know that this stuff really works and to not worry unnecessarily.",3
"I started taking Synthroid 200mrgs From 2002- Oct 2012. Because i had thyroid cancer.  had both of my thyroids removed. A friend told me to try  armour thyroid, and you will fill alot better. I took her advice and she gave mw the name of the Dr who will perscride armour thyroid. I been taking 90mrgs of Amour thyroid and i fill  great, I can tell the difference after i took the first pill. My energy level is very high. I dont need a nap during the day.",3
"Started Vyvanse (30mg) about 3 years ago, and still on it to this day! I am extremely more concentrated, and have more motivation throughout the entire day. This medication saved my life, and I have not looked back every since! Plus you loose weight, so that's a plus (:",3
"I have spinal stenosis in 2 levels of my lumbar spine and 3 bulging/protruding discs. I could hardly sit or walk for months. I was hoping for surgery just to ease the pain. I couldn't drive for longer than 12 minutes, couldn't exercise like I used to, could hardly work. My doctor put me on Cymbalta 2 weeks ago and within 3 days, almost all my pain is gone! I still have some numbness in my lower leg and foot but I am no longer taking Percocet and am weaning off the morphine for night time! Cymbalta gave me back my life! I hope it continues! Thank you for this wonderful medicine!",3
"What a product, very effective",3
I started methadone a few days ago and oh my gosh have I been amazed!  I have felt better in the last few days more than I have in the last couple of years!!  I have chronic pain and been on almost all the other opiates.  I fell into the opiate addiction myself.  I think methadone is a God send!!  I would suggest methadone to anyone batttling chronic pain issues.,3
"I am 21 and I had bumps on my chin everyday since I was 12. I had tried EVERYTHING, including a Clarisonic, expensive face washes, creams, etc. Thankfully, my dermatologist prescribed my Atralin and my skin is practically perfect. I had an initial break-out for about a week and a half, then suddenly my skin was perfect. No bumps and so smooth! It does make my face rather shiny, which I am not used to since I have dry skin. I am so happy with this product! It is so nice to wake up every morning with great skin. This is worth the price tag. I wash my face nightly with Bobbi Brown extra balm rinse use this gel, then apply a heavy moisturizer. Get Atralin! It will change your life!",3
"Took it for a year or so, but now I need it again and my insurance wont pay for it and my other medicines are over $400.00 a month and they want $120.00 more for Crestor. We just can't do it.",3
"I've been taking 3mg Cialis daily for the last six months. I can't say enough about how much it has helped with erectile dysfunction. Erections are firm and last long enough for two orgasms. I've discovered something else while taking Cialis. I have been dealing with symptoms of depression for several years. I've tried several of the anti depressant medications but had terrible side effects. Not to mention, it made the performance issue worse. Since taking Cialis I've noticed my depression has all but disappeared. I did some research and discovered that some studies have reported that Cialis has helped with depression in men. I've got my life back and feel great.",3
"The best BC I've tried! I'm taking it for one month and have minimal side effects. My breasts slightly increased in size, but no weight gain or acne. I'm taking it at night, so I don't know if there are any headaches or nausea, I don't have any during the day. Love it!",3
"For 1 year, I've been suffering from severe muscle pain after I finish my household chores but as my doctor prescribed me this medicine, I can really say that it really works! The pain was gone. Thanks to Soma..",3
A miracle pill for the worst of panic attacks. Nothing compares to the effectiveness of Xanax. ,3
"I wish this was around back when I was in high school!  I have struggled with acne for my whole teen/adult life.  I have taken Yaz on and off for 8 years now, and my skin never looks better than when I'm on Yaz.  The doc took me off last year because I was getting headaches and she was concerned the estrogen in the Pill was causing it, but after a year on the mini pill with the same frequency of headaches and the added terribleness of deep cystic acne, I am happily back on Yaz and already seeing an improvement in my skin.  Only complaint (mainly from my husband) is a slightly lowered sex drive.",3
"Neupro patch is the BOMB!!!!!  My RLS bothers me even during the day, but with Neupro slow release patch, no leg jitters. AWESOME!!!!!   I just can't say enough about it. My provider has been giving me samples, so I have not had to pay as of yet, I just hope it isn't very expensive, would hate to not be able to continue use due to the out of pocket cost.",3
Unreal difference.  My side effects are minimum and I'm on 20 mg a day.  This is one stop shopping.  I had terrible acne--cysts everywhere.  I'm 3 months in and it's almost completely gone.,3
I love this medicine. It has helped so much with the arthritic pain. No side effects for me. I have eye check ups every six months. Give a try!,3
"I used this medication years ago for my migraines.  Since that time, my husband has joined the Army and we have moved several times, etc.  Each time we do, I have to start all over again with my migraine treatments (I have hemi-palegic migraines) and I would give my eye-teeth for one of these doctors to just let me take Stadol NS again!  It worked so well mainly because even when I was nauseated, I would still keep this medication because it was in the nasal spray form.  This medicine was a wonder drug for me... oh how I wish it could be again.",3
"I started Saxenda on 9/1/12 and by 9/30/12 I had lost 18 pounds!  I increased the dosage each week and until I started the 3mg dosage, I constantly felt nauseated.  Fortunately, this has stopped and I am not having any side effects.  I am not weighing myself - will let the doctor do this at the end of each month.",3
Excellent control of my atrial fibrillation. Significantly improved my quality of life.,3
Excellent medication for bipolar disorder although I had a reaction to it.,3
I have been doing colonoscopy prep for 20 years. This was the foulest tasting stuff I've ever encountered.,3
"My 2 year old son has severe ADHD, ODD, and anxiety. We started him on Vyvanse 20mg, Depakote twice a day, and Kapvay .1 in the evening last week. We were worried because he talked SO much like he was on speed, and ran around the house looking for paper, books, pens to write with and never sat still but he was very pleasant when we started the Vyvanse. However, he was Always saying I'm sorry for blurting, please, and thank you which was unheard of before starting the Vyvanse.  We were noticing around 4:00 the Vyvanse wearing off and the aggression and whining came back with a vengeance! We added another .1 mg Kapvay after school with his Depakote and the result was AMAZING. He is pleasant ALL day long.",3
"I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder about 2 years ago and had my share of trying different medications to get it under control. After multiple trials with medicines my doctor finally found the right combination for me (Lexapro, lithium, (Depakote had sexual side effects), Synthroid, trazodone at night, multivitamins and B-1 vitamin). This combination worked great to get my mood swings under control. Once my mood swings were under control, I started having extreme anxiety attacks. I was then diagnosed with anxiety disorder as well. My doctor prescribed 0.22 mg Klonopin 3 times a day, as needed and it is a lifesaver. Klonopin knocks my anxiety down within 12 min. I have been taking it for 3 yrs with great results.",3
"Clonazepam has drastically improved my life. I used to be afraid to go to sleep. I have seriously injured myself in my sleep in addition to harming others. After one night terror, I required surgery and decided it was time to see a sleep physician. A small dose of Clonazepam and I sleep great. Highly recommend.",3
I'm on 200 mg of Zoloft and it has changed my life!,3
Works Great! I will never use anything else.   2nd time on it. Just had my third planned baby and also breastfeeding.,3
"I'm still in the early stages of taking XYREM (week 2), but it has changed my life. I almost never take naps, and have had my narcoleptic episodes significantly reduced.  I get around 8 hours of sleep every night, and can stay awake with no issues all day. Sometimes in the morning I feel a little groggy, but can't get back to sleep which i'm sure is just the medicine wearing off as it goes away shortly after I get up and about.",3
"I've been on 120mg of lithium for 3 days, after 2 days I'll be on 300mg and then gradually go up. I've suffered from bi polar &amp; depression for over 3 years, I've been on 12 different antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. Nothing seemed to even stabilize me. The past few months I've gotten so bad to where I've thought about suicide constantly. I was so depressed, easily irritated and cried over the littlest thing. Lithium has so far, saved me. I feel the best I've felt in a LONG time! I have no side effect as of yet. My mind is completely cleared of any negative thoughts. Although it's only been 3 days I'm hopeful things will keep getting better from here. I'm so glad I tried lithium!!",3
"I have always been vulnerable to bronchitis and pneumonia.  This antibiotic is the only thing that works.  It leaves a bad taste in my mouth yes but I know that after 3 days I will be done and better.  Before I was prescribed this, I would often have to take more then 3 days of antibiotics in order to get better.",3
"Most of my life I have struggled with severe panic attacks, general anxiety, PTSD &amp; moderate depression. Been on meds twice before until I felt better &amp; then I would stop taking them. This last time it had been close to a year that I had been suffering again before I decided to reluctantly go back on meds. I tried Celexa again- it worked kinda okay in the past but this time it made no improvement for me. Saw the doc who switched me to Prozac- all I can say is WOW! Best yet- I feel like my old, happy self after only 1 month! 3mg the first week, 12 the second and 20mg the last two. Give it time to work &amp; be patient- it might make you feel a bit off  not better at first, but it is a miracle drug. These bad feelings will pass hang in there!",3
"I've been on every antidepressant known to mankind and they were awful to me. Either the side effects were too bad or it turned me into a complete zombie to the point work was out of the question, and then my dr said we would try one more called Prozac and the reason he had not prescribed it before was because it took 2-8 weeks to reach full effect as where the others took less then half that time. I started out taking 3mg because I have always been very sensitive to antidepressants and their side effects. For about the first 2 or 3 weeks I experience light anxiety... Then finally the 2 weeks passed and still nothing, but then finally about 8 weeks into the mediation, I feel like Santa Clause on steroids! It has saved my life! ",3
I was just diagnosed in my 40's with generalized anxiety disorder not surprised.  I was always having anxiety/panic attacks and unable to function some times.  I now take Celexa daily and while it takes about 2 months to really kick in my anxiety is gone and I feel FAR beyond how I have felt in forever.  Zoloft nor prozac worked.  I don't know they are truly geared towards anxiety.  Highly recommend it at 3mg if not feeling better.,3
It works well for TSH supression,3
Epiduo is amazing. I tried all sorts of acne creams and this one is like a blessing. I went to my dermatologist and she gave this for me to use! This is my second week and most of my pimples have eased and are gone. I'm impressed with this product and I will keep using it.,3
"Two years ago, I couldn't sleep, my doctor gave me all type of sleep meds, nothing worked. The only med works is this. I take 2mg every night on and off for 2 years. No side effect.",3
"I was on this birth control for about 8 months straight and I went off now I am currently back on and I absolutely love it. No weight gain, no acne, lighter shorter periods. The only thing is when I first started taking it, I spotted for a month, which is normal. Other than that, I love it.",3
"I started taking this medication 3 years ago. My doctor told me it was non-narcotic and non-habit forming.  Up to that time I had never had any addictions to drugs or alcohol, but unfortunately I am dependent on this drug for sleep.  It does however work very well with few side effects and I wake up feeling refreshed.  ",3
"I've had the Nexplanon for over 2 years and I absolutely love it.  The only issue I've had with it is my periods are very irregular which is no big deal for me. I get a period for 2 weeks and then I'm period free for about 4 months, then it will return. I have no problem with that. I plan on using this birth control method for 2 more years. I love it.",3
"This literally changed my life. I can now wear colorful shirts without worrying about sweat stains. It worked after the first application. My doctor said I'd experience mild itching and I wish she would've been more truthful and said practically unbearable itching but the longer I use this medicine, the less I itch. I don't itch at all anymore when I put it on. If I use it daily, I get a dry, painful rash in my underarms so I use it every other or every 2 days.",3
I was born with Asthma had been in and out of hospitals since birth.  When I was old enough to use my own judgement on inhalers I decided to try Primatene Mist.  I have used it for over 20 years.  I only need to use it...maybe...2 times a month...if that.  NOTHING the doctors gave me ever worked.  Primatene Mist keeps me OUT of the hospital and home with my family.  ,3
Unbelievably good.,3
"Been on Testim for 2.2 months. Huge improvement in mood, and physical stature. Started working out again. I feel great! Strong and sexy. Wife likes it too! My libido has increased and the reaction from other females is incredible. I lost 22 lbs prior to starting and am now seeing my abs again. The energy is awesome as I motivate a group for business part time. Love the smell. Application is a daily chore but worth it.",3
"Today is my third day with flagyl for BV. I do have a weird taste in my mouth, when I brush my teeth and eat. To prevent yeast infection I eat yogurt, and take a probiotic powder packet that's fizzy and you mix into water like an emergen-c packet. I also wear long dresses and nightgowns around the house without undies to help with air flow which heals and prevents yeast infections. It's my health and going commando , taking flagyl, and drinking water to dilute the concentrated urine, all have been helpful in stopping side effects.",3
"I decided to use this birth control after constantly changing oral contraceptives because they were just awful, mood swings and gained 30 pounds in 2 months. This has been the best birth control I have been on. No weight gain. No periods. No mood swings.  I get acne around the time I should have a period each month. Also no pregnancy so that&rsquo;s good. I was skeptical to use this birth control after reading reviews. But it  been the best thing for me. I recommend this to anyone of my girl friends.",3
"I've tried Prozac, Zoloft, Celexa and none of them worked well. They would work maybe a month and the depression crept back into my life. I started taking Viibryd and the recommendation of a doctor and trusted friend and my life has changed dramatically for the better. I don't have the wiped out feeling and my sex drive has stayed the same. This medicine has been a God send for me. I had to fight to get my insurance to cover it but it has so been worth it.",3
Expensive but it works! No negative side effects.,3
"Took sporanox for approximately seven months to cure complete infestation of toenail fungus (both feet/all toes). Sporanox had started to clear it all up when I ran out of the capsules. I was overseas and unable to get a refill. After stopping the medication for a period of time, the fungus returned to its previous state. Upon my return to the U.S. I did not pursue another Rx due to concerns over liver damage. But, if your liver is healthy and you can take it for an extended period of time, Sporanox seems to be a very effective cure. Much faster than topical meds I've used since then, although like I said soon after I stopped taking Sporanox the fungal infection returned to its previous state.",3
"Because I am a recovering alcoholic it is crucial for me to find non-narcotic treatment for the persevering pain of my chronic pancreatitis. I was feeling a bit hopeless with the repeated prescriptions of pain meds (which of course offer only temporary relief, and for me a danger of over-use), until my GI prescribed me Gabapentin. This med has been incredibly successful in mitigating my pain, while also giving me huge energy (I'm a consistent runner so this factor is welcomed), and allowing me to move forward with my sobriety. I give it four stars, though I realize like anything, it's not for everyone. That said, good luck to you all with finding what works.",3
"Expensive but worth it! My uric acid was in the 9-3 range and I was having several severe gout attacks every year. I tried allopurinol but didn't work, so started on Uloric 40mg about 2 months ago. Had a few minor attacks during the first 2 months, but since then I can eat or drink anything and doesn't cause any flashes. Doctors office just called and the uric acid level was 4.8.",3
"Genetically, I am cursed with acne. For years as a young teen I struggled with acne on my forehead and cheeks. I tried every potion and cleanser out there, to no avail. When I went for my physical, my doctor noticed how bad my acne was and prescribed clindamycin gel, and boy has it worked wonders. I have very sensitive skin, yet this did not seem to make things worse. I have occasional breakouts, but my skin looks absolutely fantastic after 2 months of use.",3
Works amazing! A life saver!!,3
I have been on this birth control for 8 years and had no problems at all. It was great. I recently was put on a body acne medication that lowered the effectiveness of this brand so because of that reason I am switching to Zovia I hope it's as good.,3
"Love this medicine, works great with less side effects of regular Suboxone!  Also with discount program I am saving  very happy my Dr. told me about it.",3
I was on Celexa 20mg for a full year due to anxiety and panic attacks. The medicine was working great. I had to switch doctors and my new one suggested to a try Lexapro. She said its a cleaner and better medicine then Celexa. I said ok I'll try it. It's been two week and no side effects at all. It's been great. I'm glad I switched. I'm taking 3mg of Lexapro now which is the same as 20mg Celexa.,3
"I'm 18 years old and have had all three of these shots. I don't understand why people make this shot to be such a big deal. It barely hurt when I got them. Even if it did, who cares? If the shot is going to help you out in the long run. I never had any bad side effects I recommend it to any woman who likes to be proactive.",3
"After many years of chronic bloating and constipation, I finally tried Linzess. I was taking Miralax daily, sometimes twice a day, for about a year but still no relief from the horrible bloating. I'd eat half an apple and have to move my belt buckle. Now, a little over a month on Linzess and I am no longer bloated, I go every day and feel SO much better!!!!! No side effects at all. I just learned that taking with food can result in diarrhea or help if you feel constipated again. Will try that if I ever need it.",3
"I have been taking Toprol XL for about 2 years. My doctor has now put me on 200mg twice a day, total 400mg a day, this had to be approve by my insurance company and it was. This is working for me, no side effects and my blood pressure is steady at 114/20.",3
"As everyone else I have a terrible problem sweating and can only wear black t shirts or tank tops. I only started using this a year ago and aside from the burning and soreness after, its great. However, I just went to refill my prescription and was told that they are no longer manufacturing it, I went to many pharmacys and was told the same thing. I don't understand why.",3
I love this medicine. I do not sweat anymore. I don't have the armpit stains. I can wear whatever I want without worrying about sweating. If you have excessive sweating you should try this product.,3
"I have suffered severe pain for 20 years following a  motorcycle accident. During this time I have tried every sort of pain relief available to me, mainly narcotic drugs which I found as bad as the pain itself. Earlier this year I was prescribed Lyrica as far as pain relief goes...fantastic. After a few months (1x 22mg cap per day) I experienced total confusion and was unable to perform my daily tasks at work or at home. I was becoming agitated and experienced suicidal thoughts. Things returned to normal after a week or so of not taking Lyrica. Because it worked so well I am tempted to give it another go. It was just so good to not feel the pain anymore.",3
"My son and wife both came down with bad cases of the flu, and I started to experience extreme chest tightness, cough, and fever about five days later. Took my first dose of Tamiflu about 12 hours after experiencing symptoms, and within 12 hours was feeling 20% better. Within 24 hours was 90% better. No side effects. Simply a miracle drug, and everyone should have a box in their medicine cabinet.",3
"I took this on top of taking SAM-E for depression and fatigue. I'll put the good first. This supplement is amazing. Makes me feel much more confident, much less socially anxious, and more able to be assertive, and have no fatigue. AND I am interested in things again. I feel joy from looking at the mountains and such. It started increasing my facial twitches from SAM-E which also Ritalin brought out. SJW feels kind of like a drug like Ritalin but with a much lower up. I've got to say I feel pretty good taking it. I take 320mg once in the morning, a double dose at 2:00, and a single dose again around 2:00. Sometimes I will take another dose around 3:00 p.m. I feel like I don't need the SAM-E anymore. Highly recommend.",3
Very effective.,3
Cleared up my abscess ..Also I kept getting bacterial vaginitis for a year straight. I swear my bacterial vaginitis cleared up! This actually works to clear that up also. I thought my bacterial vaginitis issue was stuck with me forever.,3
as a supplement to levothyroxine it has been a night and day difference. I no longer sleep all the time and can think clearly. I actually want to do things now.,3
"I have tried almost everything under the sun as related to acne medicine. The only thing that worked for me is Aczone. I have only been using it for 3 days now but my face has cleared up so fast. I have never seen my skin look so good in the last 2 years. It doesn't irritate the skin and goes on very light and absorbs right in. Highly, highly recommended.",3
"I've had back pain for almost 3 years now, sometimes to the point of tears due to simple actions like walking or bending. After being put on this medication 3-4 doses daily, I have had the pain relieved, and my actual mood and focus has increased at work. My previous evaluations and reviews were below average and now after being put on this treatment my last two reviews have increased to above average. It takes effect quite quickly and lasts for the directed amount of time on the prescription. The only con I have for this medication is that it affects myself in a negative way during intercourse. I have found when on the medication my climax takes 3-4 times as long or not at all during that time. Quite frustrating.",3
"Had severe diarrhea, admitted in hospital. They gave me Flagyl,and it stopped the diarrhea. Then at home 4 years later had severe diarrhea and used 200mg of Flagyl 3 times a day,and was well. Thank the Lord for Flagyl.",3
"I had this in hospital when I broke my arm. It worked awesome. The only negative was the constipation, unable to relieve myself for 4-2 days after.",3
"Started smoking at 13, up to 2 1/2 pack a day. Wife also smoked, up to 2 packs a day.  We both started Zyban at the same time.  Took meds and smoked for a week, stopped the smoking, then a week later, stopped the meds.  Haven't regretted doing it.  Although I don't feel a whole lot better, still huff and puff at the top of the stairs, gained about 22 pounds, but I know we are both better for having quit.  Recommend to anyone who really wants to quit.",3
Zantac worked wonders on me. I have taken this medicine for 3 almost 4 years now I used to not be able to eat. After I started this medicine I was able to eat a lot more. This worked wonders on me. The other day I took a Prevacid and it didn't help at all. Also this didn't work on me at first until my doctor put me on this 2X daily.,3
I get migraine and have found out by taking everything from prescription and over the counter medication that Excedrin was the only one that really worked. Now I can find them in any store.,3
I got the Implanon 3 years ago and have had no side effects from it. Got it taken out today and had the Nexplanon put in the same spot. I am a bit sore from it but it was a much easier procedure then I thought it would be!,3
"Suprep was absolutely wonderful! I added ginger ale with the solution and water. After taking the first dose at 2:00pm used the restroom for 1-1/2hrs, was able to sleep without interuptions. Second dose at 4:00am was also great, was able to sleep  1-1/2 hrs also. The Colonoscoby was a great procedure. I oped out on the anesthesiologist, I felt no need to pay two MD's.  I had Versed and Fentanyl in the Ivy, it worked great. I was anxious and nervous,  I wanted to reschedule the procedure do to my anxiety. But I didn't, if I can do it so can you. Good luck God Bless.",3
"I was prescribed Bactrim for a bacterial skin infection under my arm. I get infections easily and am often on all kinds of antibiotics. Many bother me, but I have not had any problems at all while on Bactrim. And the skin infection has been clearing up very well (I'm almost done with the medication.) I'm very happy with this medication.",3
Ruconest works perfect for me! I can self-administer and it works much quicker than Berinert and Firazyr. Also no issues with side effects so far. Thank you so much Ruconest! (And also my insurance ).,3
I have been on Depo for almost two years and it works like a charm! I never go past the 2 day period to get the shot and it is crucial for it to work to not exceed the time of your next shot. When I first started I did bleed for a month but it was not heavy. My periods lasted 8 days and cramps were horrible before the shot so it wasn't that big of a deal for me. Now I don't get periods ever and ever so often i might spot for a day or two. To be completely frank my partner and I do not use protection and I have not gotten pregnant so as far as contraceptives go this one is wonderful! I did experience dryness at first but it has since gone away.,3
"I found that this medication made a HUGE difference within even the first day of taking it, however, the nasty bitter taste was really hard to get by &amp; I even threw up once when i was trying to take it, BUT I discovered taking the pill with milk masks the nasty taste, I now put the pill on the back of my tongue and swallow it down with water. Try it, I guarentee it will help",3
Used on cracked hill on my feet.  Applied 3 times a day for two weeks.  Wonderful.  My feet are like a baby skin.,3
"This drug is saving my life right now. Its a shame the people who abuse it ruin it for those of us who get relief from debilitating issues from it, because many doctors just don't want to prescribe it now. I say what's the point of having a drug if you can't use it to help people who need it.",3
"I have taken Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, and then my Doctor Put me on WellButrin XL 120 in the morning and that was helping me but not in the evening so she increased the Wellbutrin XL to 300mg in the morning and 120 in the evening and that was working, my mood seem to be great! But then I learned since I take the 300 and 120 that there was a new formulation on the market called Forfivo XL 420 and I take that once a day in the morning along with some Lamictal 30mg and I feel GREAT. I don't have the worrying I had at work with coworkers, or the mood swings I had while I was at work or being with family. I still take Klonopin 1mg three times a day for my anxiety and panic attacks and I take Klonopin 1mg at bedtime and Elavil 20mg to help me sleep.",3
"Finished treatment almost a week ago. Undetectable virus load two weeks into treatment. Virus remains undetectable  Odd mild headache which lasted a couple of minutes, but took no medication whatsoever avoiding possible interaction. I've had no other side effects. I continue working and living my normal life. I eat plenty vegetables; smoothie made of fresh bananas, blackberries, blueberries, mango and kiwis. I kept the weight at bay and drink fresh beetroot with green apple. No alcohol or fried foods drunk lukewarm water mixed with fresh lemon juice  swallow raw garlic with an empty stomach.

"After giving birth, lay up in a hospital bed and taking all kinds of medicines. Milk of Magnesia is the best way to get the well needed relief. For me, it doesn't cause any of that rumbling you get with laxatives. Thanks.",3
"I switched from Risperidal to Abilify two years ago.  On 12mg and it works much better for me. On Risperidal my symptoms (paranoia) still poked through, but not anymore.  Also the side effects are a lot less present.  I still sleep about 3 hours though. Otherwise my functioning is high.",3
"You owe it yourself to give this medication a chance. Been dealing with insomnia for 3 yrs. Then last year my little brother killed two people and committed suicide. My anxiety, depression, insomnia went into overdrive. No meds worked. Was prescribed 20 mg of generic Seroquel. If you've had insomnia for years, nothing is going to work the first night. You're worked up about the insomnia and so desperate for the pill to work that of course it's going to be a night from hell. That led to a rocky 2nd night. Night 3 I slept great! It takes 2 1/2 hrs for onset. I owe my life to this medication. If you have the kind of insomnia that is near psychosis please give this medication a real chance. You do not have to suffer anymore. Sweet dreams.",3
Amazing topical relief. I 30% recommend it.,3
"My hubby has been using this for years and has always said it works.  I AGREE 30%.  We are having difficulty finding it in the pharmacy stores, it seems that they are not carrying it anymore. ",3
"I've suffered for years with allergies both seasonal/environmental and chemical. I carried Benadryl and hydrocortisone in my purse for years.  I recently had issues with my ight hear with vibration and popping as well as hearing my inhalation through my nose in my ear.  I also had awful post nasal drip year round for as long as I could remember. I went to an ENT doc and he prescribed me Astelin.  I take one spray in each nostril in the morning and again at bedtime.  I've been on it for about a month now and I have never felt better.  The hives have decreased, my swollen hands have gone down and my ear is like new! I highly recommend this antihistamine nasal spray. Inquire with your doctor about it!",3
"My Father was given 2-8 weeks to live after his routine hip replacement turned into - this man has stage 4 lung cancer....Xalcori was our last hope....as we made his funeral preparations we noticed he seemed to be getting stronger not weaker.  He started gaining weight , not losing.  My Father is alive because of this drug....I'M TEAM PFIZER!",3
"This is an exceptional medicine. I have been on it for only a couple of weeks. I have tried Seroquel, trazodone, Ambien and none of these have worked but alprazolam is a miracle medicine.",3
This product is amazing. Cleared up fungus that I've had for over 30 years in less than a year.,3
"I was diagnosed with AFIB in 2012 at the age of 43, long sad frustrating story cut short, the doctor said there was nothing he could do about it. He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 22 mg/2x daily and I FEEL GREAT! I couldn't believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack. I agree that it makes me drowsy which is becoming less severe I LOVE IT! :)",3
Ive been taking Dexilant for 3 months. Now I have diarrhea. Besides that this is my miracle pill.,3
Takes pain away instantly. Amazing medicine,3
"I have been on this medication for over 9 years and it works great for me. My periods are way lighter and the pain is much more manageable. It causes no mood swings or weight gain for me. Overall, works great and is very affordable; my insurance covers all of it, but even without insurance it's only $9/month.",3
After 8 weeks virus free !! No discomforts.Typ 1,3
"I was hooked on opiates for 3 years! Mostly snorting oxy and perks for the first 2 to 8 years and the last 2 years I was introduced to morphine H and hydromorphone as well as the needle. Although I was a mess all these years it wasn't until I tried the needle that opened my eyes to my addiction. I went downhill fast.  I tried everything but there was no stopping this. I tried cold turkey to quit a few times and almost went crazy and died from sickness. The sickness I started to feel from the needle was way worse than it ever was sniffing. I knew I had to get off but I tried methadone before and it didn't help me it made me feel the exact opposite of how suboxone makes me feel. Subs=energy,happy,stable,no urges, not stoned",3
"I was in a bad car accident 3 years ago and it tore up my already injured back. At first I relied on Cymbalta and narcotics to get through the pain. The narcotics lifted my mood and the Cymbalta did help with all other pain. Eventually the narcotic I was on (lortab) stopped working all together. I'm not a big fan of opiates for pain relief and would not have taken them had it not been my only choice to feel normal. (I couldnt even sit in my car for more than 12 mins without searing nerve pain).I accidently stumbled on a review that said Wellbutrin also helped with back pain. It has been the best thing that's happened to me. It has replaced both meds and I feel great! Cymbalta was horrible to come off of, Lortab not so much but think I was just lucky.",3
Great,3
"Low back pain, leg pain.",3
"Battled bacterial vaginitis for years before I found out about Tindamax. It worked wonders my first round of it 4 pills 2 days. I got it again a year later and this time ...side effects kicked in big time. My fingers were sore, severe muscle aches, red inflamed spots on my chest, fever and headaches. It lasted 1 whole day but the bacterial vaginitis was gone and haven't had it since but it gave me a yeast infection.",3
"After taking buproprion hcl XL 120mg a day I felt some relief from depression, anxiety and adhd. My MD thought I should see a psychiatrist and would not increase my dosage. I went online and found that the proper dosage for me should be 300 mg a day.  As a duplicate bridge player my performance went from last to an astounding first place finish yesterday. Listen to your doctor but do your own research.",3
Given for back pain due to ruptured disc it works fairly well. Thanks,3
"Started off with Concerta in May 2012 it was not effective at all, switched over to Adderall XR 3mg in July 2012 for seven days as a starter dose, then started Adderall XR 20mg,  I noticed a considerable difference between the two medicines instantly. I am able to focus for a very long period of time without being distracted, my grades improved exceptionally, I went from receiving grades below 22% now my lowest grade is 83%. The benefits of this medicine do outweigh the side effects for me, I noticed 20 minutes after taking Adderall, I have increased bowel movements, lower libido and decreased appetite. I stop taking Adderall during breaks and long weekends, the first day not on it, I am extremely tired, exercising and eating healthy helps.",3
Great miracle.,3
If not for this antibiotic my husband would have been dead several times over. Incidentally I'm a Registered nurse. I see where a number have people have attributed wild side effects' to this drug. Many are confusing symptoms of their illness with side effects of the antibiotic. Just because you experience something unusual for you when your sick doesn't mean its the fault of the antibiotic. Being ill is an abnormal state for ones body yet some of these people seem to think that any effect of the illness they weren't expecting MUST BE attributable to something else and often they blame the treatment rather than the illness. If you've been prescribed Levaquin I urge you to take many of these 'reviews' with more than a grain of salt! An EXCELLENT drug!,3
"My experience with Ovace Plus has been amazing.  I've tried over the counter shampoo like Nizoral and Loprox (prescription) and nothing has worked for my dandruff like Ovace.  They stopped making it for a while and I freaked out.  Its now back!  Please try it, not only did it do wonders for my scalp but it even seemed to help the skin around my hair line in my face.  It was $20 with my prescription but ask the doctor for Ovace discount card and you might be able to get it for $20.  You won't be disappointed.",3
"I take 300 mg 3x a day and I feel the best I've felt in 3 years. Nothing has worked to calm my anxiety like Gabapentin including Klonopin or Xanax. I'm happy, relaxed, motivated and most importantly my appetite for alcohol which I used excessively to calm my anxiety has completely disappeared. I hope I can take this medication for forever. Life is finally good again.",3
I am a type two that went into Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and spent three days in the ICU. Once I got out I found an endocronologist and he put me on Glyxambi and My numbers stay between 90 and 120. I also do not eat very many carbs. My doctor gave me a discount card that I use when I get my script filled and the 30 day supply is free with the card. I feel better than I have in years and my last A1c was 2.2 I have been on this drug since April 2012 and today is Oct 22th 2012,3

"I started Isentress twice a day along with Truvada once a day and my HIV Load was 28,000 and CD4% 31%. After 40 days my HIV load is 20 and CD 4% 32.2. Excellent improvement considering I have experienced ZERO side effects and all other lab work came out well. I am 49 yrs old and very active.",3
"I have struggled with nail for 8 or ten years. All but two toenails were dark. The big toes were thick and tender. I had tried all the home remedies and four bottles of Formula 3 bought from my podiatrist. The Formula 3 was the only thing that gave minimal results. My dermatologist prescribed Kerydin which is working great for me. I was applying twice a day for the first two months. This caused redness and peeling so I cut back to once a day. After four months of use, I can wear sandals again. My left pinky toenail is still thick but will probably heal in time. I'm sorry it isn't working for everyone but keep trying different things. You never know what might work for you. I'm blessed that my insurance covers this or I couldn't afford it.",3
"I've had pins and needles in both hands from a pinched nerve in my neck. Muscle relaxers, stretching, new pillow, heat, nothing was working. This works really well.",3
I have suffered depression off and on for over 20 years. I take Cymbalta for chronic pain and still have fallen in a deep depression. My doctor added Pristiq and after day 1 I'm feeling much better!,3
2 years. No health issues or pregnancy scares.,3
"I was told by several doctors that I may be bipolar and finally went in to the psychiatrist recently. I was experiencing major mood swings and mixed emotions, paranoia. I couldn't even go to the grocery store without my heart racing and my chest tightening and thinking horrible gruesome thoughts. I have always been on Effexor XR 120 mg a day for my depression and anxiety. The doc added to it 40 mg of Geodon at night to start with, and I have never felt so free. I can think clearly and not dwell on every racing thought. The racing and paranoid thoughts are actually gone and I can handle reality again. I could probably stand to up the dosage a bit but this medicine has been a miracle for me. I have felt amazing.",3
"A couple of years ago I ended up with anxiety and depression. My doctor prescribed Citalopram. I started at 20mg and after a couple of weeks increased my dosage to 40mg. There were side effects. Sweats, waking up at 3:00 and not able to get back to sleep. It took sbout 2 weeks before I felt great. Much happier, little to no anxiety and my wife notice the change for the better. I stayed on Citalopram for about 2 months and over a month kept reducing my dosage by 3mg weekly until I was off the meds. I had no withdrawal at all. Felt great as I went off the meds.  Had some personal problem that sent me sideways and the doctor put me back on Citalopram. took about 2 weeks for it to work just like the first time. Feeling myself again",3
"I've had the Implanon for about 2 months now. The insertion hurt a little bit but it was definitely worth it - the next 3 years of worry free birth control. I absolutely LOVE not getting a period anymore and I truly trust this method enough to not need the reassurance of a period. The ONLY things I do not like about Implanon are the mood swings and weight fluctuation (about 2 lbs more or less). People close to me have really noticed a change in my irritability. I wouldn't consider myself a extremely bad by any means, it is tolerable, I just demand a lot more alone time than I used to. I would recommend this birth control to anyone.",3
I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis several months ago.  The pain was so debilitating that I couldn't even see patients for about 3 days (I'm a dentist).  The pain brought me to tears.  I was afraid that I would have to go on disibility.  My new urologist put me on amytripyline a few weeks ago.  It worked almost immediately. Most days I'm almost pain-free.  I got my life back.,3
First day of Adipex.. My doctor wrote me a prescription for full dose but advised me to start with half of a pill due to anxiety I may have. Took the half pill this morning and boy do I feel the energy.. Hopefully I can stay on the half strength but I've been reading reviews that say that the effects wear off after a few days. I'm a nurse so I do like the extra energy.. My starting weight is 212..ultimate goal is 122..but for now getting under 200 would be great. Hopefully I can use this extra energy to go to the gym..I'll keep everyone updated. I love reading everyone's weight loss stories.. Good to know I'm not the only one who has weight loss as an issue. Best of luck to everyone.. And stay hydrate,3
