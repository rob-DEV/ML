"After 2 months on this medication it did nothing for my manic-depressive bipolar disorder that I was diagnosed with. It caused me to rapidly put on fat and riddled me with anxiety. I've never had a panic attack in my life until I took this medication. I was prescribed latuda 40mg, after 2 months had numerous panic attacks and gained over 12lbs of fat, made me very angry and anti-social, it's also expensive as hell even with insurance. I quit taking it and forced myself to workout and eat clean and I feel 10x better than when I was taking this crap. No more depression, no more panic attacks or anger. My bipolar symptoms are completely gone from just changing my diet and adding structure to my chaotic life.",1
I would not have taken this medication if I knew it was going to effect my sex drive. I am thankful that I was only on it for a short time and I have stopped taking it a few days ago. I have been married for a longtime but we have a very active sex life now that our children are gone from the house. If I would have known that I wouldn't be able to have a orgasm during sex I never would have agreed to taking this drug. So if you value your intimacy with your partner do not take this drug or expect a lot of frustration !!!,1
"My doctor started me on a very low dose of this (100mg). I have anxiety, depression, and (a questionable diagnosis, pending review) of bipolar disorder. The first day I took this I had a full blown panic attack. My heart was racing so fast and I was experiencing pretty bad chest pain and heaviness, so much so that I called the office and they wanted me to stop taking it and go to the ER to have an EKG done. I stopped taking it for about 2 weeks, but wasn't ready to give up on it - big mistake. So I went back on it for 3 days. Each day I had elevated heart rate, and felt anxious all day long. I was EXTREMELY irritable to the point of rage, my ENTIRE face broke out with painful cystic acne I'd never had before - basically over night. Skip!",1
"I wanted to give birth control a try so my doctor put me on Tri Sprintec. It started out okay and I was fine with the outcome despite the nausea. However, I then began getting this white milky discharge a week before my period and when I had sex it smelled fishy. I went to the doctor and it was diagnosed as Bacterial Vaginosis..I have tried many treatments to ward it off nothing worked. I'm getting off Birth Control and getting my life back!",1
"Horrible burning, made my itch even worse after application,  I used this two previous times 2014 and 2016 with good results but not this time apparently the formula was changed cause the pain and itch is unbearable !!! Don't buy this Monistat 7 it's. instead  go to the doctor . I'm even crying ugh!!!",1
"So the first day of my last period was Oct. 13 2016.I had unprotected sex 13 days later in the morning of Oct26. I took plan b Oct27 just less than 26 hours later.I started getting cramps Nov.4,2,6. Nov7 I had fresh blood in my underwear so I put a tampon in thinking it's my period. There wasn't really much blood on the tampon so I put a liner on and didn't bleed again til Nov.9(which was my expected period day). Because I never had a period so light I was online and read about implantation bleeding. I was freaked out so I took a pregnancy test today Nov. 10 and I'm pregnant. I don't know what to do I'm still spotting but it's brown now. I think it didn't work for me because I was ovulating and I must have release an egg in those 26 hrs",1
"I eventually thought my weight probs were over, I was High as a kite and couldn't wait to start taking them after reading all the Positives about them, alas, it was the most disappointing thing thats happened to me,They did NOTHING for me,not even the Sleepiness occurred that people posted about.I just decided to be determined and eat as much as I  could, But as much as eat I'm still stuck on 8 stone,4 st less than my norm.I can only assume it is other Meds I'm on that is Blocking them from working,So Despondent.",1
I had unprotected sex on May 29th. The pull out method was not used (alcohol was involved). I took the day after pill about 4-2 hours after sex. I am  and 168 lbs. Found out the pill did not work and I am in fact pregnant. Took 3 pregnancy tests on June 19th... all positive. I am not sure if it was my weight or possible alcohol involved on why the pill did not work?,1
"Was on Concerta xl for 7 days and had to come off it due to the unbearable side effects of the drug. I  was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive sub type) generalised anxiety and depression. This drug made me feel very nauseous, gave me a headache, made me shake, gave me twitches throughout my body, messed my brain up in terms of cognition etc, made me very aware of my heartbeat, made me extremely anxious to the point of not being able to leave my room or communicate with anyone and just generally messed me up. At one point i was doing some stretching on a yoga mat to try and calm myself down and i felt so confused that i didn't know what to do with my legs. This drug wasn't for me and caused an unpleasant experience.",1
"I was prescribed doxepin by my Dr and was not given any informed consent regarding side effects or interactions. I am shocked that I had so many side effects almost instantly, very dangerous medication and I am sorry that I ever followed my Drs advice. I would be very careful with this med and any med that you put into your body. I wonder if the CEO of the company that invented this would let their children take it?!",1
"This is the worst birth control I have ever been on! I am 31 years old and recently had the nexplanon removed. BIG MISTAKE!!! I never write reviews but this birth control is the DEVIL!! While on the nexplanon I never had cramps, bloating, breast tenderness, or horrible mood swings. Glidess I have all these symptoms plus paranoia, and depression. I have been taking these pills for a month and half and never have felt more insecure in my life. The weight gain is an issue as well, I gained 12 pounds within the 1st month. I realized that this birth control was making me feel crazy, anxious  and not myself so I made an app.t for my OBGYN for a better option. I cant wait to throw these pills down the drain. Hope this is helpful.",1
"The first time I took this (prescribed for obstructive sleep apnea) I thought wow, this is the answer! I was awake and alert but didn't feel drugged....I felt on the ball and I hadn't felt like that in forever. The second time I took it I felt extremely tired. I forced myself out of bed but felt extremely depressed and anxious. I took anther tablet not realizing I was having a negative reaction to this drug. I became so tired I stayed in bed all the next day. I felt disorientated and it was as if everything was in slow motion. I could not get out of bed and was more tired than I had ever been in my life. My heart beat was fast and it felt irregular. I started to have negative thoughts and hallucinations. Not good!!!",1
"My original experience with Zoloft was over ten years ago, during a serious depressive episode - it seemed to be effective as a stabilizer.  This past December, a doctor prescribed it again to help pull me out of another down-turn.  Within the course of a month I progressed from severe depression to ultradian mood cycling, which resulted in a nervous breakdown.  The cycling abated within a couple weeks of discontinued treatment with Zoloft. ",1
"I took this drug for three months and it worked wonderfully for the pain. However, after three months, I lost bowel control, which is a possible side effect.",1
"I was recommended the nexplanon after I was told I could no longer take the pill due to my history of blood clots. At first I thought, yay I can just have it in my arm and forget about it! Man was I wrong! My insertion was August 2012. I weighed 184 lbs after having my daughter and I weight 226 now. I had constant mood swings, feelings of depression, brain fog, constant fatigue, super bad acne, and I spotted ALL the time. I don't recommend this to anyone. I never had acne like this before now. I have always struggled with my weight but I was so fatigued all the time I had no motivation to get up and exercise. I ate pretty healthy but it didn't matter. Just getting up and going to work was a struggle. I just had it removed today!",1
"I've been taking Atenolol for years, and though it worked fairly well sometimes, now it's pretty useless.  I get a migraine every other day.  Nothing has changed in my habits.  It's 31 years of migraine and no sign of it slowing down.  Already been through the menopause.",1
"I was prescribed Klonopin for anxiety several months ago. The dose was 0.2 mg up to twice daily.  Never having had it, I quartered a 0.2 mg tablet first dose. Seemed okay until a few hours later and I began coughing like mad. I have asthma.  Klonopin made me cough and increased the thickness of the mucus in my lungs until it was almost impossible to cough it up.  Just to be SURE it was the Klonopin and not something else, I have given it two other tries 1/4 of a 0.2 mg tablet.  Each time the same results.  I looked it up and cough is the 2nd most common side effect. FYI Naproxen and ibuprofen have the same effect on me.",1
"I was on it for 1-2 months. My period reduced to 2 days with spotting for 2 days. I went from being a nice,  timid person to getting angry for no reason towards my partner &amp; friends. I almost quit my job every time I showed up to work. I was tired ALL the time. Backed out of important social engagements. It made my anxiety uncontrollable which made me depressed. I don't recommend this to anyone who has had previous anxiety/depression. It gave me crippling back pain, which I could barely roll out of bed. I got exceptionally hungry to. I've been off it for 6 months now. My sex life &amp; drive is still almost non-existent. Sex is painful, I bleed after sex. Drs don't tell you about any of this &amp; have no clue how to fix it",1
I had paragard for a year and a half and had cramping the whole time with terrible long heavy periods.  The last couple months I had it I was in so much pain I could hardly walk. Went to my doc and she said nothing seemed wrong.  Then the next day I went to the ER and had it removed. It had slipped a little and was causing a lot of discomfort. I will never get an IUD again. I'm lucky I didn't need surgery like some women,1
"This was the worst I wouldn't give this to my dog. I was given this to treat Bipolar II when I was 22. It screwed with my sugar system, kept me near comatose and gave me tics that thankfully went away when I stopped taking it.  I would never take this again.",1
"BE CAREFUL!!  After being on Ortho Evra for 2  years my insurance switched me to Xulane and I got pregnant within the second month of being on it.  My periods were consistent while I was on Ortho, but when I switched to Xulane they became very spotty/unpredictable, not to mention the bloating and cramping I felt.I was on my 3rd month before I realized I was pregnant.  Even though my insurance covered part of the Ortho, I still had to pay $20, with Xulane it was completely free.  But now we know why, you get what you pay for.",1
"Had kidney stone and given a Zofran prescription to take home for nausea - it only made it worse.  Every time I took it I found myself more nauseous after only 1/2 hour.  I chose to stop and had my doctor switch me to a different drug.  I think some people's systems are more sensitive to it than others, especially if they are taking pain medications with the Zoran.",1
"I have a spinal cord injury ; have been taking methadone for nerve pain ; oxycodone for hip pain, over 12 years. Had been using miralax but not as effective as I would like. Doc recommended movantik, I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. Was I ever wrong. The warnings about methadone users is very accurate. Within 2 hrs I was doubled over in pain, in the bathroom nearly 2 hrs while my body cleared out. To the point of practically urinating from my butt. It was excruciating,  cramps, nausea, severe sweating  had a pressure in my head for about 6 hours. I was very ill out of it. I was extremely afraid, pain was so severe I thought something was wrong, was considering going to the ER but couldn't get off the toilet. I think this med is dangerous.",1
"I was given this in an IV (along with Benadryl) in the ER when I had a horrible migraine. The nurse said it would make me tired when she gave it to me at 4 pm. Well I was tired for about 3 min. then the fun began. Like the other poster, I started to feel extremely anxious. I kept tossing and turning in the bed because I felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I had to wait for 2 IV bags to finish before they would let me leave. When I got home I was exhausted but at the same time could not sit still to save my life. I had that &quot;wanting to crawl out of my skin&quot; feeling all night as I paced the house exhausted. I was finally able to fall asleep at 2 am. The next day I was really shaky and still a little bit anxious. ",1
Agree with everyone else. I am glad I didn't pay for it and only had a free trial. It's really useless.  Could tell no difference after using it.  I got more relief from an empty regular pro air (with just some residue coming out!),1
I went to my pharmacy and I asked the pharmacist what can she recommend for a dry cough she said its Delsym. I tell you you will be drowsy....so I didn't mind at all because its a good thing for me I can sleep.  When I took it I was waiting to see  if it was effective  - to my surprise I keep coughing the whole night as if I didn't take any medications....so if a cough product doesn't work for an adult - you shouldn't recommend it.....waste of money!,1
"I started taking Taytulla 2 weeks ago to help prevent more ovarian cysts from popping up. There is not one thing I've liked about this pill. I get TERRIBLE headaches and nausea almost constantly, I've broken out in acne all over my face, I have been suffering with terrible depression/anxiety/lack of interest in anything, and fatigue. I forgot to take it one night and the next morning I woke up with super heavy bleeding. I know the body will react when starting any new medicine, but this is miserable. Would not recommend, ladies!",1
"I've had the nexplanon since November 2012 and I absolutely hate it!!! I have not had a period since I've had it though. My sex drive is down I am depressed, severe mood swings, really bad anxiety, fatigue back pain unable to sleep pretty much all the negative side effects that you can get I have",1
Weight Gain as soon as I started taking Lyrica.,1
"Horrible pill. Went on it after getting my IUD taken out (it was giving me a period every time my husband and I had sex) and the doctor told me it would help me gain an appetite. Instead in the past 3.2 months I've gotten sick 2 times, had one missed period, and the worst period of my life after as a catch up one. I can't take the tiredness, heavy body and constant upset tummy any more.",1
"My husband is in a nursing home with dementia. He was was given this drug as a sleep aid. He is now very confused and his balance is poor. Cannot stand on his own or even with his walker. Falling almost every night. Our family are very concerned about his deterioration since taking this drug. The doctors response was to INCREASE the dosage!!! We told him NO and insisted on removing this drug from his medication. Since stopping this drug, we can see improvement in his condition. It will take time to get it out of his system. I would not recommend this drug to anyone - especially seniors.",1
Oh my goodness. I'm on fire! Don't buy this stuff.,1
"DO NOT EVER TAKE THIS MEDICATION! I've been on this for two weeks &amp; its been two weeks of HELL! My anxiety is through the roof, I'm overly emotional &amp; cry all the time. (No suicidal thoughts though) This pill will make you feel like you have food poisoning or the stomach flu or something. I have headaches, dizziness, an indigestion/heartburn type feeling . I just have this bizarre feeling near my upper stomach/diaphragm, I can't even describe it. I'm constantly gassy whether its through burping or passing gas, stomach cramps  pain, back pain down in &amp; near my pelvis, pain in my lower right abdomen. No appetite. The side effects are worse when I'm at work which makes it very hard to stay at work. Wicked nausea!",1
"I would not recommend this to anyone. I am now 2 months pregnant because my Skyla expelled from my uterus into my cervix, without me knowing. This however is partially the doctor I was seen by did not do proper follow ups, or check for the placement of the IUD, and disregarded my concerns. However the months prior with the IUD were painful and my period was extremely heavy and would last 2-3 weeks with severe cramps. If you do decide to move forward with Skyla, make sure you have a doctor you trust. As well as you know the complications of this IUD. I'm a 20 year old with now the decision on what to do next and my heart is shattered. Take caution with this IUD. Much love and best wishes to you all.",1
"Wouldn't know...got charged $40 for 2 days' worth, which I just can't afford.",1
I am 40 with 4 kids. I had my tubes tied but have experienced week long heavy clotting periods for a year. So my gyn talked me into the Mirena iud. She told me I would have no periods after the 6 months mark. Well I have had it now 9 months and I haven't stopped bleeding. I would have maybe one week of spotting and then back to full blown heavy bleeding. It's awful!!! I have been bleeding heavily for 3 weeks now with clots and changing a super tampon every hour.  Getting this iud taken out !!!!!! Hate it! My fianc&eacute; and I have gotten use to the mess of trying to have a normal sex life with all this bleeding but it sucks!!!!!,1
"I have been bleeding profusely (clots, steady bleeding) for a year and a half - yes 18 months!!  I have seen 2 different OB-GYNs.  I am 46 and have fibroid tumors and ovarian cysts.  Both doctors have used the try this and see approach and I have been given Provera, Depo Shots, and Beyaz birth control.  None of these have stopped the bleeding.  After taking the Beyaz last December, my blood sugar level rose to 420 and it took a month to get it back to normal.  Of course, now I am considered a diabetic and have to take Metformin every day despite the fact that I was not diabetic or prediabetic before then.  It is ridiculous that these doctors will not consider a permanent treatment option!",1
I have given this through IV at the hospital for migraine without being warned of side effects. Within 12 minutes my entire body felt like it was on fire and I felt unbearably agitated and insane. I was writhing in the bed and gripping at my face and they told me it would pass.  It took a benadryl and about 42 minutes to calm down. Reglan was probably the scariest experience of my life.,1
"Second day after first injection, woke up with the worst case of sour stomach I have ever experienced. Burps were out of control frequent and absolutely disgusting smelling and tasting. Made it to work only to vomit twice in 3 hours... almost messed myself in the process... diarrhea was also in full water effect. Thankfully I was able to leave early (within 1 hour of second episode). I hope these symptoms decrease dramatically and rapidly. Anyone else experience side effects this severe? I am literally unable to leave my bathroom's side. Can not even attempt to work or leave the house without fear of needing a new outfit. I took 1, 1.2 injection.",1
"This has been a terrible experience for me. I've been on Apri for about a year and at first had no major complaints. My periods were still 2 weeks long but they had always been. Over the past 6 months my periods have been miserable. Emotionally I'm a wreck, I cry all the time about everything. I feel like a crazy person but at the same time have no control over the crying. I'm constantly moody and irritable. I sweat like crazy when I have my period and often feel like I'm going to pass out. My periods still last 2 weeks one light week followed by a heavy week. I never had clear skin but this pill has only made it worse. I would not recommend and will be changing within the week so I do not have to experience another month like this.",1
"I have been on the pill for 3 weeks and I've been expierencing hair loss, acne, sore breasts, fatigue, mood swings, and it lowered my milk supply. I also had a little spotting. I have decided to stop taking the pills.",1
"I was put on Depakote ER and Celexa for depression and anxiety.  My mood and depression were helped and it knocked out my migraine headaches completely.  I experienced so many horrible side effects though. I gained 20 pounds in the six months I was on this, I lost my hair, I developed tremors that have not completely subsided, I had horrible stomach problems, heartburn, it made me extremely lethargic, libido was gone. This was just my experience with Depakote and if it weren't for all of the side effects I would have stayed on this medication.  Hope this helps.",1
"Nightmare from the beginning.   Day 1 extreme nausea, dizziness and headaches.  Day 2 was worse,  and had bloody urine.  Stopped taking it.",1
"The song fire comes to mind.  After inserting cream immediate pain, itch and burning.  I thought I was going to die and became short of breath.   I showered I prayed for Gods mercy and it worked.  There was some cramping but mild",1
Stay away from all benzodiazepines If you have BPD. You'll rage like nobody's business the next day.,1
"It's been an hour and a half, took recommended dosage, it's done NOTHING.",1
After 6 months with this IUD I couldn't take it anymore. I HAD to have it removed. I have never ever in my life dealt with depression/anxiety/panic attacks until I got the Copper IUD. (Before the IUD my periods were fairly light and 4-2 days on average. Light PMS. Some back pain) with the IUD  they were 7-8 days. So heavy I had to wear a pad and a jumbo tampon and change every 2 hours HORRIBLE cramping to where my only relieve was laying in bed curled up with heating pad. Midol/Tylenol rarely made a difference. Around my time of PMS I would suddenly feel very very depressed and sooo fatigue. And then my mind would race into a downward spiral where I would then panic I would feel this way forever.... Glad to have this out &amp; be me again!!!!,1
"I started intuniv when I was 11 almost 12 and those first 6 months were hell, I would sleep from the time I got home from school so 3 p.m. until 6 a.m. the next morning and WAS STILL TIRED! I would fall asleep in class or on the bus it was miserable. We told the doctor and she said well just push through it and push through the tiredness, might I add if you were ever on this medicine it is not a tired you can just push through. But I tried to anyways for the next year or so and I would not sleep everyday as much but there were some days where I would sleep the entire days away! It did get better but I would still fall asleep in class and be exhausted constantly!! FINALLY when I was 12 the dr took me off of that and its been so wonderful!!!",1
Worst nightmare ever! I had a slight yi and was on antibiotics so I thought I'll cut it off at the pass and spring for the big guns so I opted for the ovule. Day 1 was fine no real issues. I woke up day 2 with the biggest mother of all itches and it burned too I tried the cream that comes with it made it worse!?! My lady parts swelled . I took oatmeal bath read other reviews and decided it was just a bad reaction. day 3 hives on my thighs and hips. Then the moved to anywhere I scatched a welt would show up. The only relief for the itch was ice but I was a little afraid to get frostbite on my burning deformed lady bits. Day 4 woke up at 4am went to urgent care am on prednisone and Benadryl the Dr said don't ever use again. the end!,1
Took ambien with no problems. Doctor wanted me to come off ambien and try Belsomra. He gave me samples. Took a 10mg dose and it didn't help me fall asleep or stay asleep. Up all night. Then- the weird nightmares. I had hours of vivid nightmarish dreams. Not good. Woke up exhausted. Why would anyone take this medication if it's going to give you nightmares? I'm already an insomniac. I don't need nightmares and hallucinations too. Going back to ambien.,1
"I don't recommend this at all! I know everyone's body react different. At least mine reacted negatively. I had my period for 6 months, started having breast pain and discharge, I was always tired, and oh my gosh acne!! Finally, it was a damn painful process to take it out since it was really hard to find it.",1
"No side effects the first day, after that bloating and nausea. Final day of use prolonged vomiting and diarrhea, over 10 hours before it stopped. Discontinued use and informed doctor.",1
"I was prescribed Cefdinir after getting a sinus infection and bronchitis.  It solved that problem in just a few days, but after 3 days on it, my diarrhea became intolerable, far worse than the original sickness.  I stopped taking Cefdinir.  It's been over 3 weeks now of non-stop gastrointestinal pain that landed me an clonoscopy procedure, stool cultures at the hospital, and persistent diarrhea.  The worst of which culminated in a near black out from pain on the toilet.  My case may have been a rare exception but I'm certain Cefdinir is no friend of mine.",1
In 3 days of use I had itchy scalp within 2 weeks I had to be taken off due to itchy rash on neck and face as it was getting worse. It has been 2 weeks on new medication and I am still having the breakout.,1
"I have had the copper IUD for close to two weeks. Unprotected sex with my boyfriend and long term birth control are the ONLY pros. Cons include: acne, anxiety, low sex drive, fatigue, weight gain (4 pounds in one week). cramps, random shooting pains. I am a thin woman with a high metabolism have found it impossible to lose the weight. I look puffy feel horrible. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone. I'm getting it removed today.",1
"Have suffered with insomnia for years. Tried many medications with Zolpidem  ER (Generic Ambien ER) 12.2 the only one that helped. Even then, still was not getting great results at times.  Tried 10 mg of Belsomra, hoping for a better result. This was one of the worst nights I have ever had in my life.  Was wide awake until 4:30, followed by horrible, segmented, almost hallucinogenic dreams. After my alarm woke me, I was in the strangest state of mind, where I had to make myself speak. I finally told my husband, I'm sorry, I've got plenty of conversation in my head, but I have to MAKE myself speak.  I was afraid to drive after this, and had my son drive me. This condition eventually got better. One dose. Never again.",1
"Dr gave me 300mg 4 times a day for what they think is infection in my foot after a drawer fell on my foot and had fluid on top of foot with swelling. After 3rd dose throat was swollen. Couldn't swallow made the left side of my chest hurt so bad it felt like a heart attack. I was itching so bad. I was so thirsty. I went to ER, Dr said he had never heard of anyone having a reaction to that med. Gave me a shot of benadryl it helped. It wore off and everything happened again. Days later my stomach is cramping. I have been drinking pedalite &amp; Gatorade. Still feel thirsty. I am allergic to penicillin  bactrim so Dr thought this would be a good one. It is not. This is wicked stuff. NEVER EVER will I take again",1
Bad side effects!,1
"I was given metformin for borderline type 2 diabetes. It made me want to sleep all the time, caused my sugar to go up, and caused stomach pain.  Obviously this medication is not for me. ",1
"I started using Contrave the last two weeks of December.  During the first two weeks of December I was already down 12lbs just from watching what I ate, so in taking this I thought it would really kick my weight loss into high gear.  I was completely wrong.  I took this medication for 6 weeks and did not lose a single pound.  I continued doing what I had been previously, watching what I ate, drinking tons of water, and was up to the 4 pills a day dosage.  The only thing this did was make me nauseous.  Since stopping the medication exactly 6 days ago, I am already down 9lbs.  It is not worth the possible side effects.  I had high hopes for this medication, but was unfortunately let down.",1
"I got Nexplanon abut a year and a half ago and I can not wait until I get it removed. I get frequent migraines, I am having problems fighting depression and major anxiety. I have acne all over my face, my shoulders, my back, and it's even started on my stomach area. I have my period for about 3 weeks every month and it's not just spotting, it is extremely heavy, and I have cramps constantly. My sleeping habits are way out of wack; its either I want to sleep all day or not at all. My appetite has sky rocketed and I feel like I can never get enough to eat and yet I've lost a TON of weight since getting it. I have absolutely no sex drive what so ever. I would never in a million years recommend this to anyone. I hope this gave some insight",1
Went to the ER for a headache along with depression and was given compazine threw an IV an has been feeling detached from reality every since last year of november anybody else feels this way after taking this medicine and what do I need to do to get back to NORMAL all I do is cry and wonder why the doctors didnt warn me before taking this ,1
"DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE TAKING! Consult with your doctor but also be aware of the side effects involved. Symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, muscle weakness, slowed speech, muscle spasms, twitching / fidgeting, nightmares. Not for everyone.",1
Began the free trial and took Belviq for 2 full weeks.  No weight loss at all not even a pound!Made me feel very tired and irritable.  Had trouble waking up in the morning. Had dull headache and constipation.  I would highly recommend utilizing the free trial first   This medicine can be very costly.,1
Bottle is almost impossible to open. Who knows if it's effective or not. I suggest get pharmacist to open it for you before you leave the store,1
"I'd rather stay constipated than used this again! Used Coloxyl with Senna to treat 4-day constipation due to a viral stomach bug. Supposed to work in 8 hours but 4 hours after taking 1 tablet i got bad stomach pains, nausea and a general unwell feeling. Lasted all night and into the next morning.",1
Feel like a walking zombie - unable to work or operate in a normal environment.,1
"I was prescribed escitalopram for anxiety and panic attacks. I did not have any difference in anxiety and instead suffered from extreme depression and suicidal thoughts within a few weeks of being on it. My doctor made me promise to try this one for at least 6 weeks and the feeling only got worse and worse. I had to slowly ween myself off (as warned to do), and feel 100x better with that stuff out of my system. Apparently this side effect is rare, but very scary.",1
"I've had this nexplanon since September and at first it was great! I had very light bleeding on and off for about 3 weeks and then it went away. After the bleeding I started to feel myself changing. Feeling  more tired then usual. All I want to do is sleep. and the weight gain is really bad. I use to eat mcdonalds every day, only cause I worked there, and I still was not this big. I can barely fit my jeans and by boobs are so big I had to buy a ton of new bras. I figured I needed to change my diet but I don't even eat as much I used too and I am twice as big as I was. My skin is also getting super dry. I'm getting this taking out as soon as possible because the mood swings are scaring my parents and friends.",1
I developed severe akathisia (restlessness) while taking this medication. I had a difficult time sitting in one place for more than a few minutes and it was absolutely exhausting. I also developed insomnia and TD (tardive dyskinesia) and altogether I would say this medication was very difficult to tolerate. I was happy to be taken off of it.,1
"I have gotten my nexplanon in the middle of march and have gotten it removed thursday. It is effective of not getting you pregnant but the symptoms are not worth it i was thrpwing up,dizzy, having hot flashes, bad ass stomach pains and back pains very far more worst than having another baby. This was my first time receiving any borth control and will be the last cause of this have me feeling like this aint no telling what the other ones will do to me ! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BIRTH CONTROL TO ANYONE!",1
I have needed to get my four wisdom teeth pulled out for 2 years now. And just on this medication until surgery. My  mandible which is my lower jaw and gums are very swollen and infected not so much  pain in my upper areas in my mouth. My dentist prescribed me Tylenol #3 with codeine and antibiotics . Tylenol 3 is a joke it does not help with my pain at all it just makes me very drowsy. When I do rest the pain is still severe.,1
"Over the last 4yrs ever since having my nexaplon implant I have had serious mental and physical health problems and it's completely affected my life and everything in it. The pain is unbearable sometimes, it says it's does stop your periods but to not have one for nearly 2yrs can't be healthy. My depression and anxiety have gone through the roof and I'm always tired but can't sleep. It has gotten to the point where I'm ready to cut my arm off but I didn't believe that something so little that is supposed to help you could cause so many life changing problems! I would not recommend this birth control to anyone I'm 21, nearly 22 and this has ruined my life and changed me as a person completely I don't ever feel happy or like myself!",1
"Only positive: I have PCOS  this pill cleared my acne up nicely. This pill made me feel like an absolute raging psycho. I am angry, irritable, depressed, tired, and just absolutely so miserable on this pill. I've also gained about 12 pounds (lots in my stomach) in the last 7 months since I started it, and have developed melasma. I've been on numerous birth control pills and this is THE WORST. Changing pills ASAP. I'm tired of feeling this awful. Hope your experience is better if you're reading this.",1
It gave me a brownish dishcharge that would not go away until I pulled it out for good.  It also did not stay flush  to my cervix as I expected it would.,1
I just inserted the cream. It feels like I am being burned from the inside. WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. I am heading over to CVS tomorrow to return this. As soon it was inserted I wanted to cry. I wanted to get it all out. If it feels any worse I am going to urgent care. This company needs to have a class action law suit against it. This product should not be INSERTED into people. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!',1
"Wasn't too bad to insert. First 3 months I had continuous spotting. Period stopped after 3 months. At first it felt fine.. Developed GAD and anxiety disorders half a year in and started crying for no reason at everything and had to see a therapist twice. I thought it was just me going crazy until a year passed and I got my period all of a sudden. My monthly periods then would last 10-12 days and hurt like hell. Cramping was UNBEARABLE. I never cramped on BC pills or off BC pills, but all the time on Mirena. I was depressed, tired, gained 10lb and was always hungry, anxious 24/7, and sensitive to every little thing. Removed my IUD after a year and a half of use and switched back to BC. VERY disappointed with this- I had such high hopes",1
"Do NOT take this medication at all costs!!! Ended up in the ER after 3 dosages. Doctor's can't tell what's going on wiht me. I'm going to see another doc this week to do more tests. I still feel very dizzy, weak, having heart palpitations, can't concentrate, anxious, depressed...I'm going crazy because of this stupid drug!!!!!!!!",1
"I've been using linzess 290 for a couple of years off and on because if stops working after a couple of months. I started it again and I'm finishing up my 2nd bottle and nothing. No results whatsoever. I use enemas a couple times a week and all I can get out are hard, round, tiny, rock like poop is all I get. I don't know what else to do.",1
"Was treated for a urinary tract infection but I had no symptoms, so I really don't know if it actually helped. But I ended up with a yeast infection afterwards. Only took it for 3 days.",1
I've been sick for 3 weeks and a doctor at an Emergency Med place prescribed this for my nagging cough. In the past when I've been sick with something like this I was prescribed a narcotic cough medicine which helped me get the sleep I need. I was hesitant to take a pill and came on this site. My own intuition was telling me NOT to take the pills. All of these negative reviews have helped me confirm what I already felt inside!,1
"I don't recommend this birth control to anyone.  Ever since I got it in, it has been a non-stop emotional roller coaster, my mood swings are out of control. Also no sex drive, no energy and weight gain.  But the worst part is I tend to have 2 or more periods in a month. Started my period,  after 7 days it stopped, two days later I am bleeding heavy again,  was on my period for another 9 days.  One time I heavily bled for 20 days straight. I'm getting this taken out.",1
"I was placed on Cymbalta for chronic pain as a result from injuries sustained in a head on car accident right before my 19th birthday that also caused 2 very rare recessive gene's to activate (hemiplegic migraines (neurological migraines) and Raynauds disease (circulation disorder) in my lower leg's and feet). At first the pain control was unbelievable. However, 2-3 months into my treatment I began having psychological repercussions where I felt like all my emotions were trapped inside my head. Although I felt angry, sad, happy, etc, I was unable to exhibit those emotions. Cymbalta was discontinued. My head injury was suspected to be the issue as to why I had the adverse reactions I did because my brain didn't function or process normally.",1
"This was the WORST product I have ever used!  Within an hour of using Monistat 1, I had severe itching and burning.  I was frantic to get it out and resorted to a vinegar wash and a few warm water washes.  I have probably now just given myself a bacterial infection on top of everything else, but the itching and pain were SEVERE!!!  I would never recommend this product for anyone.  STAY AWAY!!!!",1
"I had the implant for three months and then had it removed. I became very emotional, overly sensitive and very depressed. I initially did not recognize that this was being caused by the implant but as soon as I did I made the appointment to have it removed. I felt significantly better within a few days. I know everyone is different so I am not writing this to deter anyone from getting it but rather to share my experience.",1
My Mother took Aricept 2 mg. for one week.  She has vivid dreams and can not tell if they are in fact dreams or real. Also very tired.,1
"I tried this medication for insomnia.  I had been taking Restoril 30 mg to help me sleep but it had stopped working as well. My doctor gave me samples of Belsomra to try and said I needed to start at 10 mg but it probably wouldn't work until I titrated up to 20 mg.  I had the worst night I've had in a long time after taking this. I became confused and upset.  I began crying and became dizzy and felt as though I couldn't breathe. I was terrified to go to sleep. I apparently did fall asleep at some point after lying awake trying to keep from going to sleep due to fear. I had horrible dreams.  Never taking this again. Worst night I can remember in a long long time. I've felt horrible all day, groggy, and nervous.",1
"I got this for the same reason as everyone else, because I hate taking the pill. I must say I give it a 10 for birth control considering I'm constantly on my period, so I can't have sex anyway. It's been three months that I've been on my period, and the constant bleeding caused a bacterial infection which then led to problems with UTIs. I am miserable, but my doctor made me sign an agreement saying I couldn't get it removed because of period problems, so now I'm stuck. I would not suggest this product to anyone who plans on having sex in the next six months or doesn't want to pay to constantly buy pads or tampons. It is becoming expensive and not worth all of this hassle.",1
"I was prescribed buspirone because of being on Suboxone and the doctor didn't want me mixing my Suboxone and Xanax. I took my first dose of 10mg, which I was to take 3 times daily and had a very bad experience. I felt like the room was spinning, nausea, my legs were like Jello and I was scared. I had been taking Xanax for 2-6 years and wanted to come off anything addicting. Unfortunately Buspirone was not for me.",1
"Awful, severe, intolerable constipation! Almost complete blockage on my same high fiber, vegetables, fruit,  low fat protein diet.  Took for two weeks and it never got better. Going back to my Lexapro generic.",1
My son has been on this medication since September. I have taken him off. I didn't even recognize him his emotions were so high and the anger and aggression was unbelievable!,1
"i took this birth control for 7 months straight and my periods continued to get less and less each time and every month they would come 2 weeks early during the white pills, and my period has stil not regulated and on the 7th month i had no period at all!!! lots of cramping and feeling like pregnant but was not. horrible!!! i have not lost any baby weight at all bc of this pill!! do not recommend!!!",1
"Worst drug ever-- I am usually not allergic to any drug but I Just took it for 2 days and have the worst body pain, muscle soreness, feverishness. The list of long term side effects from this drug is appalling. As a scientist and cancer biologist I usually take extra caution as to what drugs I consume but the side effects of this drug is scary and having experienced it first hand I am stopping it just after two days of use. My face is still dry and has acne and I am close to 40. Hopefully a topical cream will help- definitely not solodyn!",1
I read a lot of comments on hydromorphone and thought it would help me greatly with my chronic back pain. So I was shocked when I got the 2mg script and got no relief in pain whatsoever even after taking 6mg. ,1
"My pharmacy changed my birth control pill to this. From the very beginning I experienced symptoms that my doctor did not explain to me. I began experiencing shortness of breath, tachycardia, severe dizziness, heart burn and indigestion. I also noticed that every time I drank coffee the symptoms would get worse. I do not recommend this medication. I got off this medication about 3 weeks ago and now I'm feeling much better except for the occasional dizzy spell. Working out and eating well have helped me manage the symptoms. Please consider other brands because it's not worth feeling sick all the time while taking this medication.",1
"I had one shot for PSA ,Psoriasis and it looks like I have gotten stung by a thousand bees and my psoriasis is worse six weeks after my shot. Needless to say I did not get the second shot. Worst drug reaction that I have ever had.",1
This medication was awful. My numbers were never very good with this medication but I gave it a chance to work. It landed me in the hospital. I couldn't urinate cause my kidneys were failing. I do not recommend this medication at all!!!,1
"Cymbalta, unfortunately, did not work for my general anxiety disorder.  I took it for two months.  The worst part was that it made me feel nothing and my other medications less effective.  The good part was that it made my frequent urination decrease--probably because it made a lot of me feel numb including my bladder.",1
It is super expensive. I've used it one year now for four toenails. I helped one nail somewhat. Three toenails are still having the problem. NOT a success. Pure rip off to make money,1
"Had this for a skin/ wound infection. Took 3 into the course and felt so awful had to ask for different ones. Dizzy, out of it/ woolly headed, nauseous, bad taste in mouth, everything tastes awful, farty and generally a horrible experience. It makes sense about feeling terrible due to it killing bacteria in the body but I never want to take it again.",1
Worst medication ever. Ruined my health. It's chemical lobotomy.,1
"I was not able to function on this medication. I took one half of my pill as directed. 30 mins later I was hot, felt sick, everything irritated me. I was dizzy. I had to lay on my couch for 3 hours. I will never take this again.",1
Didn't work for me. 18 years old and had sex with my boyfriend then he came in me. Took the pill about 11 hours after and missed my period that was supposed to come 2 weeks later. 1 month later and I took a test to find out I was pregnant.,1
"This is the only anti depressant I've ever been on and I've been on it for about 4 months now I've had about 4 seizures and I twitch as I'm falling asleep and in my sleep I shake uncontrollably, I've read a few reviews similar to mine only theirs were worse and have been hospitalized. I am a normal 20 year old healthy female I only suffer from depression and I'm on suboxone I am switching this weekend to Zoloft I put it off for so long because when I don't have these pills I feel extreme withdrawal and my head feels crazy and brain zaps all weird I can't handle being off it so I was scared to switch. But to each their own my personal experience with it wasn't good other than twitching it works.",1
"Diagnosed with fibromyalgia I went to my doctors to discuss further help in dealing with the pain, and was immediately given Cymbalta 30 mg., no talk about my Estroven that I was taking for menopause, nothing. Found relief first two days, immediately as directed and found through the course of 3 weeks, the following interactions, irritability, more pain than ever before, which forced me to take more pain pills to combat the pain, and then finally a rash, then difficulty speaking, then finally the ultimate was massive confusion. Please be careful to those who are taking homeopathic medicines, and trying to help themselves with Fibromyalgia.  Be your own ADVOCATE and do the RESEARCH first...don't be a stastic like I almost was.",1
"I lasted less than 3 weeks on Movantik my provider recommend! I ended up at up at ER because of the severe cramping, violent vomiting, bloating, nausea that had occurred. I'm being asked if I had ever had colitis or diverticulitis in the past which is a fat no!  They had to put me on an IV bc of the dehydration. I've been off Movantik for a while and my GI is still irritated. Huge disappointment but I'd rather give natural birth to more children because it was a breeze compared to the experience I had with Movantik! Now it appears I have to seek a GI doc to deal with the after effects of being on it!",1
"Was given this pill by my doc for insomnia. I took the pill at 10:30 pm, was very drowsy by 11:12 pm but was also unable to fall asleep. The severe drowsiness lasted about 2 hours, yet I was unable to sleep. I got up to move around until I thought I could sleep, and felt off balance and mentally a bit out of it. Finally fell asleep at about 1:30 am, and woke at 7:30 am feeling awful. Still at 9 am I feel a bit out of it, but most of all I am absolutely exhausted. The sleep wasn't good, in fact it was a terrible experience. I will not take this ever again.",1
"Two attempts at treatment for fibromyalgia with Lyrica. Both had similar outcomes, in that the &quot;cure&quot; was worse than the illness. Side effects were overwhelming from the onset: increased fatigue, terrifying anxiety, tremors. In addition, this drug's efficacy was zero. I received no positive effects from Lyrica and discontinued use. Side note: I need to learn about illnesses that affect me and medications that I take or are offered to me. Doctors may mean well, but I need to know how they affect ME, not just what is printed in a package insert. And if a doc is not right for me, it's time to find her replacement.",1
"I have three primary headaches types and neuralgia due to lower back injury. Intractable Migraine, migraine, chronic cluster headache and sciatic neuralgia - 1st dose ramped my 'easy' cluster headache to a 10 and my neuralgia on left side is killing me and I want to throw up. What a great freaking drug.",1
"I was given this as instead ofLoestrin, which I normally take. I've been on it 2 months and it's like I have a non-stop period. They're also really heavy which they have never been in my life and my breasts get very enlarged and are so tender. I'm not happy with it at all and will be using something different beginning next month.",1
I know everyone is different but I had to have skyla removed after one week due to the pain it caused.,1
"I was prescribed this medication by my PCP for my fibromyalgia in Feb 2016. I should have known something was wrong when I gained 7 pounds in about a week &amp;/a half &amp; I wasn't experiencing much pain relief. I continued to take it. The doses would need to be increased often &amp; I was up to 900 3x/day. I took it for over a year &amp;  was taken off of it when Lyrica was started. Lyrica didn't work out due to adverse effects. I recently started this again &amp; I've gained 6 pounds in less than a week. I've been extremely hungry so I've been eating more, even though I'm trying to lose weight. This medication has also made my pain/brain fog worse &amp; when you have fibromyalgia, you don't need that getting worse. Never again!",1
"I started taking Cymbalta Time Release (for Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety) before bedtime at 11 p.m., 2 nights ago. I felt fine that night, until the next morning. I started feeling very nauseous and sick, (which I have a severe phobia to vomiting), I started sweating, chills, dizzy feeling, which threw me into a severe panic attack, which made me feel even more nauseous, which made my panic attack last longer. I couldnt calm myself down. I felt like I was in a nightmare!  I didnt start feeling any better until about 8 pm that evening. Its been 2 days since ive taken Cymbalta and im still experiencing major panic attacks 3-4 x a day with nausea and vomiting. I wish i had never taken that medicine now!",1
"I started taking this medicine 4 days ago. On day 3 the cramps started so badly that I couldn't do anything without my hands involuntary becoming fists, sometimes both of them, to the point of my husband having to help me pry them apart. Also had dizziness, nausea, muscle pain, among others. None of which I had on the Benazapril. Talked to my doctor yesterday and he switched me to something different. I'm hoping it helps!",1
"I didn't want to deal with the inconvenience of a 7 day treatment which has worked so well for me before, so I decided to try the ovule. I cried first, when it got beyond tears I used a icepack. I ended up in the ER and they had to apply a numbing agent in addition to giving me an injection for the internal relief. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!",1
"I never had a problem with regular Amox 872, I asked doc to prescribe regular Amox for a recent upper respiratory -- instead I got this 'enhanced' version.  What a mistake. Every cough resulted in stress incontinence including severe explosive diarrhea. My overall symptoms got worse -- asthmatic bronchonitis with wet cough developed. This went on for 2 1/2 days until I read the side-effects and read the caution to IMMEDIATELY stop the med if severe diarrhea due to potential GI problem it can trigger. Never again, will I take this med.",1
It causes me to shake constantly and gives me a feeling like I'm about to vomit for hours. It also keeps me awake all night.,1
"I've had pcos since I was a teen, very irregular periods dr says I don't ovulate. High school sweet heart and I got married and we want children. It's very difficult having pcos. Dr proscribed provera to induce a period. She said it would shed the lining and would be like starting &quot;new&quot;. Took 1 pill a day for 7 days. Took 3 days to start my period after last pill. I do not recommend this pill to anyone. I've had severe bleeding for several days and large blood clots. I soak through at least 2 super plus tampons an hour. It leaks so bad through the tampon I have to also wear pads. Pads have rubbed me raw and the baby bleeding and constant changing of tampons has made me raw from the top of my vagina to my butthole. I'm very weak and dizzy.",1
"I started having episodic migraines when I was 8, and it turned into chronic migraine when I was 16 (I'm 18 now). Untreated, I usually have a migraine every day. After playing with a few different treatment options, my doctor put me on Pamelor. 20mg for the first two months, and then 100mg for the second two. Almost as soon as I started taking it, I started experiencing the adverse side effects. Dry mouth, light-headedness, exhausted 24/7. But the worst were the nightmares. Vivid, every night. I would wake up screaming. I stopped the medicine two weeks ago, but the nightmares still haven't stopped. And the medicine made absolutely no difference in my migraines. Still had them every day.",1
Abreva sucks I don't get cold sores myself but my boyfriend does and every time he used abreva like it says when you start to feel it coming on he'd use it but abreva seems to only make it WORSE and puff out. So some lady said to try GLY OXIDE you can find it at any drug store but it works 10000 times better than abreva. Just thought I'd leave this thought with some of you maybe you can try it too.,1
"Hmm about this medication...I literally do not reccomend it at all! As someone with Bipolar2 I was put on Seroquel for my rapid unstable moods, I was on it for quite some time and I noticed the rapid weight gain not just that but I was literally sleeping all the time! When I was awake I felt like a zombie. Quite frankly it's a nightmare! Thank god I went off it.",1
My experience with this drug is not a good one. I was taking tramadol for years and every few months had to up the dose. When I would run out because my body became use to drug I would take more and more to help with my joint pain. I would take 4 20 MG at a time 3 times a day.  Which is not okay and experienced horrible side effects. I now have seizures at night and have been off the medicine for a while. The shakiness and nausea from not having the medication is sometimes unbearable. I also have tremors and moodiness as well as a zapping feeling in my brain. I would call this drug the devil. When you come off of it your pain is ten times worse than it was before. It's like it mimics the pain. It is very addictive and would not recommend it,1
"I was so excited because everyone said it was so good. But now it's been 6 months. At first it was awesome. But now I have gained weight and even when I don't eat or only eat salads and eat healthy,I can't lose weight. And lately I'm extremely irritable and my depression has gotten much worse than before. Now my menstrual cycle lasts up to ten days and this month it stopped for 2 weeks and I started spotting again. And I've always had bad cramps during menstrual cycle but now it's all the time and twice as bad sometimes. I use to recommend this but now I don't anymore. I'm going to make an appointment to have it removed this coming week.",1
Doctor said to try this for heartburn its 1 pill per 24 hours... was quick to get rid of pain and acid taste wore off after 4 hours.,1
"I've been on LoSeasonique for about a month and one week. I take the pill every day at the same time. Haven't missed a day. I was spotting for two weeks, then I started my period. I've been on my period for a week and a half. I'm staying on it just to see if it gets better. But it is not worth only having your period every three months. This is torture. Plus I have the worst cramps of my life.",1
"Ive been taking celebrex for a couple of yrs, I always thought it made me too tired, about a wk ago it made me so tired I fell and hit my ribs and now I have pain in my ribs that probably won't go away for wks, I decided not to refill it and just take stuff like aleve instead, all it did was create more pain by cracking my ribs or whatever it did to it, thought people should know about this side effect especially since my doctor didnt tell me about it, then I wouldnt have hurt my ribs in vain knowing that I've helped others know this information",1
These drops ruined my hearing I developed hearing ringing and hissing and TMJ I also have now crunching all over ears and side of head,1
I took for some years. It is addictive as you need for sleep. After a while you wake up at night with heart razing. I stopped and finally I need only 1/2 .2 clonopine.  And even forget. It was hard to stop that drug. But if you need for other reasons it may work for others. I think it's bad. Thank God I'm off of it!!  You need to withdraw slowly.,1
"I never write reviews but had to share my terrible experience so that others don't make the same mistake that I've made. I had been on Yasmin for years, my doctor suggested I switch to a generic since it's free (as opposed to $20) so I gave it a shot for a month. I have one more day on Zarah and here are the side effects I've experienced in that time: nausea, severe moodiness, dizziness, yeast infection, swollen tongue cystic acne, loss of appetite yet weight gain. I'm a healthy, active 31-year old woman without any other medical issues. Avoid this pill!!",1
Was waste of my money didn't last as long as they said it did.,1
I have a seizure disorder and hypothyroidism and pre-diabetes. After just two doses had complete insomnia and horrible dizziness. Then a horrific headache. Maybe it was from my other meds or the seizure disorder but I can't take this medication.,1
"Had a bad reaction of hives and burning skin to this medicine.  Tried it twice, worse reaction second time. Not good.",1
I gained 13 pounds rapidly I was only on the medication for less than a month. I also experienced asthma type symptoms. I am not an overweight person and I am very athletic but was diagnosed with HBP. I stopped taking Benicar and my lungs are back to normal and the weight gained stopped. I know it was the medication because the extra weight went away.,1
"My 8 year old son was prescribed 2mg in the morning. He has  been on it for two weeks. At first it helped him concentrate in school but he was still aggressive with his sister and others. Week two, he now cries almost everyday at school and at home. He constantly talks about death. He keeps asking me if I will wait for him in heaven when I die. It is awful to see my innocent little boy go through this. I took him off of it right away. Vyvanse worked for him a lot better at the lowest dosage.",1
"Back pain, vomiting, fever, stomach pain",1
Does not work for me at all. If I increase dosage it just makes me feel weird and lightheaded and a little bit dizzy.,1
I took Mucinex D 7 hours ago and I can't sleep and my sinus' didn't clear up a bit. ,1
"Please do your homework before taking this awful drug. My Dr. never told me about any potential side effects and I got them ALL. So sick for months with severe lower back pain radiating around the front. Severe upper GI issues with nausea and haven't been able to eat for months. Lost 12 lbs so fast that my skin is all wrinkles and lose. I look 20 years older than before taking this drug. Spent so much time at Dr's trying to figure out what was wrong with me and all tests came back negative. Only possible thing is Prolia shot. Headaches, chronic fatigue, poor sleep. Ended up in ER thinking I was having a heart attack...pain was debilitating. At least I found out my heart is good. Have had 3 additional episodes like this. BEWARE",1
I have been on Deplin 12mg for about 3.2 months. I have the mutation and was hopeful that this would help. I noticed no change whatsoever in my anxiety or depression. I also started having severe joint pain and nothing had changed but adding Deplin. My doctor recommended that I stop the Deplin. I have been off for 3 days and continue to have joint pain. Would love to hear from others with a similar experience.,1
"I was instructed to take this as needed for anxiety, however, it never helped. Which surprised my providers. I went through multiple doses before I was finally able to stop it and switch to a much more effective medication.",1
Absolutely doesn't work. I'm a 70 year old male. I exercise daily for 30 minutes and I eat a healthy diet. Just couldn't control portions. After 2 months I gained 1 pound. I had high hopes but this pill is a waste of time and money.,1
I'm 37 and didn't always have issues with BP. I have been Norvasv 2.2.mg for about a month. It has made me worse. I have been to the ER twice because I feel lightheadedness. I feel like I am going to faint. I do not understand. I never had any issues until I started taking this medication. Has anybody else gone through this? Both hospitals couldn't find anything.,1
I have been taking since May and I am sick every day. I have never felt this bad taking any medication my doctor is going to have to put me on something different.,1
worst birth controL. BADDD MOOD SWINGS! ive been taking for about a year and ive noticed all i do is cry over dumb shit. I am starting to have really bad anxiety and i quit i didnt even finish the whole back. everytime near my period i get angry . dont take this. please.,1
"Dr tried to get me to switch to this from Ambien.  I finally gave in and was given six 12mg samples.  I am on the 2th night, and have fallen asleep 1 time before 2am.  Tonight I took it at 9:30 along with my melatonin ultra and benadryl.  It is now almost 12:30 and I'm wide awake.  I'll probably get some sleep around 4a.m. like I generally do, but I will wake up feeling awful.  This drug gives me the worst feeling in the morning, like I'm sleepwalking with a migraine.  I'm going back on the Ambien.",1
Awful experience on depo. Only had one shot - never again. Bleeding non stop for 3+weeks. Serious mood changes and anxiety. Total loss of libido! Been to the docs twice but nothing can counteract it so stuck with it making me feel lousy till it wears off. Do not recommend this contraceptive to other women. I would rather have be sterilised than feel the way I do !,1
Been on opioids for a few years.  Taking Miralax for constipation.  Dr asked this month how my constipation was going. When I mentioned going twice a week she seemed to think that wasn't good so have me samples of movantik 22mg.  Took first time before dinner and it worked great!  Thought I would just take when feeling constipation.  A few days later took a morning dose.  I used the bathroom fine but afterwards Oh the Pain!  The worst stabbing lower intestine pain I've ever felt.  It came in waves for hours.  Bent over thinking of going to the ER.  I've been impacted before and had to go to the ER.  So embrassing but would choose that over mavantix every time!,1
I am almost on my second pack and I have had 3 periods in the time I have been taking this. I'm constantly nauseated and feel the need to throw up &amp;  have painful cramps the first day of each period.,1
"at this point 14 days of pure HELL !!! . Depression, paranoia, extreme fatigue, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, cycling thoughts. I am convinced this is permanent.",1
It takes about 2 weeks to even start working fully.,1
"In addition to the very, very long periods, pain everyday, weight gain and fatigue. I also experience mood swings which also have been very unhealthy to my relationship. I felt like when I started having hunger pains, or when I got so extremely stressed out, if would trigger my period. I could be on at night time, wake up off, go to work and start stressing, and then my period always comes when the stress does. I'm forever cramping as if I'm on my period.",1
VERY POOR pain control.  difficult to open each dose.  does not stick to cheek well.  does NOT work.,1
"Wanted so much for this to work for me but I had side effects that were not bearable such as severe agitation, high anxiety, and irritability from one pill.",1
"I have been on Camila since I had my baby in July 2012. I breastfeed so this pill was the best for me at the time. I just had a consultation with my primary doctor due to a very big increase in my weight, before starting this pill I had  lost all my baby weight. I am now 22 pounds heavier, the heaviest I've  been all my life. I have had headaches, hairloss, mood swings,low sex drive, and irregular bleeding. After reading all these reviews it has become very clear to me I need to stop this pill immediately.",1
I've been taking lessina for less than 2 months now (for my Pelvic floor myaliga )and I've had a horrible experience so far. The end of the first pack (around the 2 white pill) I started my period and the first 2 days were fine (other than the fact that I'm constantly in pain) but the 3rd day I was terrible I went through 6 pads with a bunch of clots mind you I've never had clots with a period before. So I had to go to the ER.  Which they had to give me IV fluids and pain medication because the pain I had was so much worse than just the usually periods I get. They told me it was from the BC. And I should be switched right away. I also suffer from depression as it is and I've just haven't been able to pick myself up. I've been on so many BCs and nothing helps.,1
"My son 13 was taking this and it made tics worse. Blurred vision, erection. His tongue would do weird thing.",1
"I would never recommend implanon (the rod) as a form of contraception to anybody, I have had mine in almost for the full 3 year term as I was on the pill and kept forgetting to take it, as I was only 18 at the time I needed some form of contraception so I came across implanon. It all sounded well and good but the whole time its given me nothing but grief. I have put on 10kgs, sometimes I don't have my period for 2 months then other times it will be every week on and off heavy bleeding, I am so lethargic and never feel like going anywhere or doing anything and I've also been diagnosed with anxiety since being on this.  The headaches are constant! I CAN NOT WAIT TO GET IT OUT! WOULDNT RECCOMEND TO ANYBODY! especially young girls!",1
"Xulane has been effective as far as keeping me from getting pregnant. However, I have an appointment with my obgyn to switch to a new method asap. I was on Ortho Evra for about 14 years and absolutely loved it. I experienced no side effects. When I was switched by my insurance to Xulane, the symptoms have multiplied. Started with lack of sex drive and intermittent bleeding. More recently, the cramps have become debilitating and I have them 2-3 weeks a month. I feel bloated all the time these days. And upon reading everyone else's reviews, I am beginning to wonder if these extra 2-10 lbs are the result of this medicine as well since I haven't been eating anymore calories than normal.",1
I took two aleve and my back pain hasn't even lessened. Still hurts the same after 4 hours and it's supposed to work for 8-12 hours.,1
"DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS METHOD!! I got the implant on 2/10 (it's been about 3 months) and already this is the worst decision of my life. At first I was so excited to not have to worry about pregnancy scares, forgetting to take my pill, and the nausea I would receive if I took it at the wrong time of day. But man was I taking advantage of that. The first thing that happened was painful cramps and prolonged bleeding, my libido completely ceased to exist and I was uninterested in sex, I noticed the weight gain, gained about 10-12lb already!!Next the acne came but this was awful, cystic acne on my jaw and back and face, now I'm experiencing extreme depression and anxiety. Please do not get this it's not worth the pain.",1
"This is the 4th statin I've tried. After 3 weeks of Pravastatin 10mg, I am sore, stiff, and ache in shoulder, neck, legs and feet.

I have used the lidocaine patches by Watson for years for osteoporosis in my neck and back and they decreased my pain from a 10 to a 3.  No narcotics needed.  Now I have been given the lidocaine patch made by Milan and they are absolutely HORRIBLE. .WASTE OF MONEY.. USELESS. Not only are they nearly impossible to separate from the plastic backing once you finally get them on they start peeling up immediately. . These are a total waste of money and someone should do something about this because the Mylan company surely doesn't care. .. now I will need to take a pill to help with the pain...,1
"I had the Implanon placed in November of 2011. Since then I have been on my period almost non-stop. I am only 20. I had it originally because I was told I would no longer have a period which meant no cramping. Obviously not the case. I am extremely tired. I have also had very very extreme mood swings, anxiety, depression and so on. Most of which did not occur until a couple of months later. For a while I thought I had something seriously wrong with until I read other reviews of people having the same issue. I have always been a very happy, laid back person. But lately I snap on everyone from my boyfriend to family. I am having it removed.",1
"This did nothing, and I mean nothing, for my cough.  It was a total waste of money and time.",1
"I have had the Oxytrol patch on for only about 24 hours and understand that it takes between 24 and 48 hours to notice any improvement, so I have noticed no improvement yet. It does not stick well and I have had to put adhesive tape around the edges of the patch to keep it on.   I don't know if I picked a bad spot (middle of my stomach) but certain ways it turn, it seems to pinch.  I used nicotine patches years ago and it seems that if these patches were smaller and less rigid, they might adhere a little better.  I like the idea of a patch lasting 3-4 days, but I would prefer using one smaller patch a day if they stuck to the skin better.",2
"Overall no major side effects but I do think I've gained weight. I am very active -strength train 2 days/week  run 20km per week and eat quite healthy around 1200 calories/day and cannot shed this extra 10 lbs. I think it's the Zarah. As far as acne goes, I have mild acne &amp; have not noticed an improvement.",2
I took this as a sleeping aid due to a very hectic schedule that was stressing me out. It did help me go to sleep and stay asleep but I noticed that I was somewhat dizzy at times during the day. Over a six week period the dizziness became worse. I went to an ENT thinking perhaps I had an ear infection that was messing up my balance. He told me to discontinue the diphenhydramine and try valerian root (I didn't want to use any more drugs) and it would take time for the drug to get out of my system. I've been off the med for a week and still have some dizziness going on. This drug is definitely not for continuous use!,2
"I have been on Zoloft for the past two months.  In that time, I have been less angry and anxious.  However, I have gained 20 lbs.  I have had gastric banding surgery and I follow Weight Watchers.  I stay within my food intake guidelines and in the past month I have introduced exercise.  I was losing weight steadily at a healthy rate before I started on Zoloft.  Even though the medication is working to help my anxiety/OCD/and depression, I am willing to try another medication because the weight gain is one of the issues affecting my moods.  It may work for some, but I am finding more and more people who have had a drastic weight gain while taking the medicine.",2
"I began taking Adderall tablets, 12 -22 mg off and on, sometimes using Ritalin tablets instead. Both medications, although chemically different, have been bad for my sex drive. Adderall was preferable as it did not cause me to feel so emotionally vulnerable and 'weepy' as Ritalin. BUT learning that there's a neuro-toxic impact from Adderall that does not occur with Dexedrine has made me ask the question: why not Dexedrine? I do not enjoy the Adderall 'high' I always take every medicine as prescribed AND vacation. Adderall helped me focus but *felt* physically mean. Now my psych doctor has prescribed Dexedrine ER. I look forward to enjoying sex again. ",2
I have been using this pill for 3 years. I feel this pill helped clear up my acne. I have lighter periods and my cramps are not as bad. I would recommend this pill for anyone who has a heavy flow and really bad cramps. Now my period only lasts a few days and hardly any pain....I do however get really emotional and moody! And have a decreased sex drive. I'm thinking about getting off of it because of my mood swings. Hope this helps.,2
I'm only on day 7 of this medication so too early to tell but I'm am experiencing severe nausea as expected ,2
"Today is May 12, I started at a low dose of 22mg cut in half. I do notice I'm not having the fears. My child has a rare cancer with no treatment or cure, so I really thought of her death daily. I'm able to not think negatively now which is healthier for both of us. I have no side effects that I'm aware of yet. I am just starting out and on such a low dose. After reading all others here, I think I would like to stay on a lower dose, maybe less than 100mg. We will see. There is another part of me that just does not want any of this but the reality of it all is, I may feel this way now because the medicines are working. I have been on 100mg of Seroquel for 2 years for sleep. I am going to start to wean down and maybe off it, on Doctor's recommendation of course.",2
"Was on this for about 3 months, normally the time frame for deciding whether or not your body reacts well to a medication. Periods were fine and normal, lasted about 2 days, light to moderate. Still got cramps around the second day and acne about a week or so prior to my period. I started to get inter-menstrual cramping and sharp pain in between periods. Normally if I miss a pill, or few, I can take them all, up to 4, shit happens, and be fine. With this I felt really sick and crampy if I took more than 2. I gained about 12lbs in 3 months, but I also had moved across country and started a new desk job, so cant account that all to the medication. No mood swings or headaches. Definitely increased discharge though.",2
"Bladder infections, inability to urinate.",2
"I started taking Seasonique around October after I finished my last pack of Ortho Tri-Cyclen. I was fine with Ortho Tri-Cyclen, but I wanted to try something new. So far it's been okay. I've noticed my acne has flared up much more then when I was taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen, but I thought it would clear up. As of yet it hasn't gotten much better. My cramps are definitely not making things any better. It's only been 2 months.. So I'll keep on taking Seasonique and hopefully things will improve!",2
I was prescribed Elavil by my Rheumatologist and have been on it for 10 days. He prescribed a dose of 22mg but I am super sensitive to Meds and have only been taking 12.2mg. Let me just start by saying I have been on everything from Zoloft to Lyrica for depression and Fibro. I have had negative experiences with most of them. I was skeptical to even try Elavil after reading some user reviews but decided to give it a try. So far I have noticed that I have more energy and don't feel like I am in a fog.Other side effects I've noticed:1. Dry mouth 2. Weird dreams 3. Tired in am but more energy later on.4. Upper back pain in the A.M. This concerns me. 2.More social 6.No pain relief for Fibro. If anything I am more aware of it.Jury still out ,2
"I have been on Savella for about a year.  The medication greatly reduced my pain. Initially after titrating up I was on 100 mg.  However, it caused my blood pressure to go really high even with the medicine I take for blood pressure.  I reduced the medicine to 20 mg which helped some with the blood pressure . However, the nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, sweating have continued. The nausea and vomiting is bad enough that I am willing to go off the medication.  I am hoping I can find something that will help as well without the side effects.  The benefits are outweighed by the side effects for me.",2
I started taking these pills on December 2013. A month has passed and I have bad migraines that last from morning til night. I stopped taking the pills for two days and those awful headaches stopped. I did enjoy the light periods and they were short..but I'm considering changing to a different pill because the migraines are terrible for me.,2
"I've had Skyla for about a year a 1/2 now. I've never had kids and could never remember to take the pill everyday. First of all, when I went for the procedure, that I was told wouldn't take long and wouldn't be painful, was actually the worst pain I've ever experienced! I PASSED OUT from the pain when she inserted it. Not to mention the cramps I've had continuously every month since having it inserted. I had to see a new Dr due to our hospital closing  I told her I wanted it removed. She did the ultrasound and convinced me to keep it. I've been considering to have it removed  take the pill. I'm just now losing the weight I had put on, taking pills is nothing new for me now. I'm tired of the cramps!",2
"I have been taking Belviq for 1 month, but I'm going to stop because the side effects are too much.  The first week I experienced extreme dizziness, fatigue and muscle soreness.  I powered through and the dizziness finally went away.  However, the extreme fatigue and muscle soreness was too much.  I tried only one pill a day, but it didn't help the side effects.  I stopped taking Belviq three days ago and the muscle soreness is completely gone and the fatigue is better.  I was so tired I couldn't even work a full day and didn't have the energy to hardly walk.  However, it was effective at weight loss.  I lost 4% of my body weight the first month.",2
I was about to give up on this med because of the awful nausea it caused but for the past three days I have been swollowing it down with ginger ale and the nausea has miraculously disapeared.,2

Improvement in erection on a 10mg dose.  Experienced heartburn and pain in back and legs (mitigated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).,2
"I started Qsymia on Saturday, April 22th. I felt fine the first couple days but the last two days I've got a weird feeling in my head and I feel a bit full, like I've eaten too much but I haven't, leg cramps, slight tingling in my feet and itching in my hands (none of which are pleasant). It doesn't make me not want eat entirely but it definitely helps me make better choices. I've had a touch of insomnia and some weird dreams and the weird feeling in my head kind of makes me want to give up but I hopped on the scale before I started typing this and I've also lost 4 lbs so far (I'm 41 years old, 2 and started at 206) I'm going to call my doc tomorrow to be on the safe side. It appears to work but I'm not sure I can continue on like this.",2
"I wasn't near as nervous as I shouldve been before the insertion of Skyla. My doctor said that in some cases your uterus can be pointed a different direction which affects the ease of the insertion, which was my case. Im not sure if this was the reason for my pain but I have never cramped this badly. After having it removed I nearly passed out. I can normally tolerate pain but I've never hurt as bad as I did following the insertion. My cramps were nearly unbearable. I would go through spells that feel how that of contractions would. The cramping eased off after 2 days but it wasnt the end. I'm on my 2th week and although Im not bleeding anymore (I was previously on Depo which made me bleed a consistent 3 1/2 months) It occasionaly cramps.",2
"I am starting on a low dose as I was given a stimulant type at first, which made me feel sick and stopped me sleeping. So now I am on Atomxetine but just a low dose as I seem to suffer badly with side effects. At my recent assessment, the doc told me to increase dose to 40mg, then 80, but I decided to start on 20 mg, then 40 second week. Only I am finding I can't sleep so I am going to try to take about 2 hours before bedtime, see if that helps. Not sure what to do if these don't work ...Any advice would be grateful, thanks",2
"First glass okay, then started to vomit. Forced myself the other half a litre due to operation however could drink no more as I was terribly ill vomiting. My operation had to be postponed. I am now waiting an alternative. Moviprep is gross to drink but does make the bowels move.",2
"Only 1 week on this 1 pill 3 times a day. I haven't drank anything, but I haven't been in any situations that I would drink yet. I'm a binge drinker. At home I don't drink at all. If I'm out at a casino or bowling I'll go nuts and forget what happens the next day.",2
"Flomax (Tamsulonsin hydrochlorid) helped me to uriniate normally. It did make me feel very tired and weak. I was taking one 0.4 mg a day. I started taking it with breakfast, but switched to taking it after dinner. That helped with most of the tiredness.",2
"I'm 27 years old and have been on Yaz for a year.  Overall my periods were lighter and shorter, but Yaz has severely decreased my sex drive.  It also makes me feel emotionally flat. I'm switching to another pill.",2
I started taking this medication due to an inability to go to sleep. For some reason it knocks me out no matter what doseage I take. 8mg is the same effect as 20mg. I sleep at least 8-9 hours straight and feel hungover the next day. It definitely makes me sleep but I have strange dreams and wake up feeling terrible the next day.,2
"I started using Lutera for birth control and to regulate my periods.  I thought that it was working fine for the first 6 months but I started to put all my health concerns together.  I already have a lot of health concerns and it seemed to lower my immune system so I got sick all the time.  I got colds, flu, bronchitis, and was always having migraines.  I stopped using it for a month and noticed I felt much better.  I started it up again and boom, within a week I felt bad again.  ",2
"Kept my schizophrenia in check but way too sedating. Gained 20 pounds in 6 months, hard to wake up in morning, going to try something else.",2
I agree this product will make you drop the pounds. I took it a few years ago to lose weight after having a baby. In 6 weeks I lost 17 lbs. I have gained that wieght back plus more. I've decided to try it again. I have so much energy I can't sit still. The down side is I can't concentrate. I'm very moody. I can't fall asleep for at least an hour after going to bed. Sometimes I can feel my heart beating to fast. If I don't start showing serious weight loss I may stop taking it because of all the side effects.,2
"Several years ago I was prescribed Abilify as an add on to my Paxil 20 mg. Which I've been taking for 24 yrs for Major Depression. It was amazing. I was so happy. I became interested again in things that I used to enjoy. Unfortunately my only bad side effect was that it made me cry for absolutely no reason. I could be talking to someone about anything at all, and the tears would start. I had to stop taking it because nobody wanted to be around me anymore. My doctor has never heard of this happening with Abilify. Lucky me.",2
"Currently on Crestor 20mg but I cut it in half and only take maybe twice/week and experiencing mild joint aches, upset stomach in the AM hours after taking before bedtime the night before. I also tend to forget minor things such as keys in the truck, lunch in the fridge for work but not to often. I am 44 years old and have been on med for about 3 years now. I believe I will ask doctor to prescribe a milder med if possible on my next appointment.",2
"This is my 3rd day on contrave and the side effects are what are worrying me. Severe nausea comes and goes throughout the day. Sometimes it gets so bad I can't even get up and move around. I have also had sporadic hot flashes and excessive sweating. The worst side effect I saw it was on the first and second day hello when I would have terrible drowsiness to the point where I had to hold my eyelids open just stay alert and aware of my surroundings. I'm not going to stop taking the medication but I'm worried because my doctor prescribed for me to increase a pill each week until I am on 4 pills a day. I'm a female, 22 years old, 2'3  weigh 223lbs. Is this too intense of an increase? Suggestions are appreciated.",2
"I am a person who has suffered from constant yeast infections for a long time.If you stared too hard at me I might catch one .Everything irritated me from body wash/jacuzzi water/ or anything with a scent would have me right back in the dr's office. I usually prefer diflucan pills because it works but I wanted to try a different route because even though diflucan gets rid of the problem,it seems to always come back.I bought these pills from a local Walgreens and I took one orally and it did make me feel a little weird and I inserted one vaginally but it did not hurt.Slight stinging every so often but it's nothing major.I hope this works !",2
"I have had Mirena for four months now.  The insertion was quite painful but I had I had to get it done in the middle of my cycle instead of during my period so I guess more pain is normal then.  My cystic acne has come back in full force in four months and I spot brown very randomly but I suppose both of those could be due to other stresses in my life.  I am also feeling a little depressed and unmotivated, definitely gaining weight without much change in lifestyle. I am 31 with no kids, perhaps I need to work harder on my body now but 12 lbs in four months is a LOT for me.  I will give it six months to see if things level out.",2
I started Vyvanse at 12 after a 2 year run on Concerta which I hated. When I started Vyvanse I was 2'8 120lbs. I started on the 30 mg dose and within a year was down to 132 pounds. The medicine works like a charm but makes it near impossible for me to eat.,2
"I have only been on the Nuvaring for about 2 months now. This was very effective for the first month about.  After I inserted my next ring I have not stopped bleeding and its not just light spotting, its heavy bleeding most of the time.  Like it'll seem like it went away but then it'll either come back on its own or really bad when I have sex.  Also, it is giving me a lack of lubrication in my vagina.  When i have had sex, there have been a few times that it hurt really bad.  I have been very moody lately and will cry for basically no reason and my sex drive is definitely lower.  I may continue on with my 3rd ring but if the bleeding doesn't stop, I will definitely be switching.",2
"I have tried many different kinds of birth control pills during my search to find the right one. This one wasn't the right one for me. I constantly felt nauseous and developed urinary tract infections and yeast infections, strange discharges and odors. I didn't have those problems on the other pills. Also I would experience randomly on this pill the loss of my sex drive. For the people who know me, that's nothing like me. That side effect scared me and was the last straw that pushed me to switch.",2
"I have been taking Fetzima for 2-weeks. Headache is my major side effect. I am not used to having headaches and it makes me feel foggy. I do sweat more than usual when I am hot. Positives: decreased appetite, weight loss. This drug is not as effective for anxiety as Paxil, but I gained 20 pounds in 3 months on Paxil.",2

"I have started Neurontin again, and within a day or two I got some relief from my pain in my feet and legs.  I can tell when I miss a dose. It is the only medication that I have tried to take for my neuropathy. However, I was on methadone for years and I did not feel the pain until I was on a low dose of methadone. That's when I started to take the Neurontin again.",2
"This has worked very well for my acne, nothing I have tried in 3 years has worked this well. However, I am an athlete and I'm out in the sun everyday and if this same thing applies to you, do not take this. It makes you very sensitive to the sun and you will be in so much pain, especially in your hands. If you start taking this and feel sensitive to hot and cold, and notice your hands turning red then stop using this immediately because it only gets worse.",2
"The taste was the worst part, followed by all the water. I mixed the first dose with white cherry powerade after reading the recommendations of some the reviews, and I wish I hadn't. That made it worse. I could hardly stomach it. My instructions said to drink it within 20 min, but I think it took three or four hours for me to finish 70% of it. I gave up on the rest and poured it back into the little bottle so I could use the water cup, and after my stomach calmed down attempted to drink the remainder. It was easier drinking it out of that little bottle since I couldn't smell it. The second morning dose mixed with plain water was much easier to swallow. Bowels were liquid fairly quick, though weren't clear until 2hr before procedure.",2
"Well firstly I just wanted to say that I've had the best night of my life sitting here after popping two dulcolax - unaware of what's install for me. I took them at around half past midnight then came online and saw these reviews. I've been laughing my absolute head off for over an hour at all the comments. I'm partially scared, because after everyone claiming to have almost died, I'm now expecting the worst ",2

"So I had implanon for 3 years and loved it. I got it because my cramps would so bad I would have to leave school, and my periods were really heavy. For the first year, I had really irregular heavy periods, but after that my periods stopped all together and now I don't have one at all. After the implanon my doctor told me about nexplanon which is basically the same thing but it's not. I've had nexplanon for 1 year and have had no sex drive, terrible anxiety attacks, and have gained about 12 pounds. Getting it taken out ASAP",2

"I am a 20 year old female, one of the youngest patients my doctor has ever treated! Thankfully being pregnant helped me detect it! I'm on my 3rd week of treatment with Zepatier. The first 2 weeks have been fine with a few headaches here and there but now I'm in the 3rd week I've become really ill. I'm not 100% sure it's from the medication but I can't think of anything else it could be and nobody else is ill. I have a really sore throats and dry mouth, my joints hurt and I just have no energy! Luckily I've not been sick but I'm on day 2 of this illness so it could go anywhere! I'm going to speak to my doctor on Monday if I'm no better and keep you updated but I will keep on my medication so I can fight this!",2
"I am on risperidone for 2,2 years. It seems to be OK for its main purpose - I haven't had any hallucinations since I started it. However I be been leading a very balanced and calm life without any major stresses which seemed to be the main triggers of my psychoepisodes in the past. But! I've gained 22 pounds for two years and I have never been overweight in my life. Plus, over the time I developed a very disturbing hunger that never stops even after I eat lots. I feel full when my stomach is literally full and stretched. But after an hour I feel hungry again. In, addition to that stomach pains not too sure if its caused by excessive eating or a side effect on its own. Other minor side effects are muscle pains, nightmares and memory loss.",2
My first full month down. I have had severe headaches.My acne is worse then it's been in years and it's itchy.,2
I must say I am so happy I found this site. It is comforting kowing I am not the only one that feels like they have been lite on fire as soon as this stuff hits my vagina! I have used the 7 day course before and I have to say this is the worst I have ever felt. Burning and itching from inside! The only suggestion I really have is to freeze a water bottle before hand and put it between your legs. It really does help sooth and take your mind off the mindless burning and itching until it's tolerable!,2
"I'm on my first week of this pill and let me tell you, I'm really considering just to stop taking it. I have been so depressed and emotional the past few days I feel like there is nothing to look forward to in life. Also I spot every day and it yes so annoying because I want to wear my nice underwear but can't and I really don't want to wear a pad all the time. I know my body is getting used to it so I will try my best to continue it. Everyone is different and I hope that they are having a lot better experiences with it than I.",2
"Well....20 pounds gained later I'm not very happy with this pill.  I've talked to my doctor numerous times about this side effect and she says you will feel hungry all the time but you just need to tell yourself not to eat.  The weight gain has made me depressed and self conscious, beginning to think this pill is not worth taking.  Other than that, it has helped my periods and I haven't gotten pregnant so that's a plus.",2
"Have been on Livalo for a few years, 2mg a day. I'm a female, 28, 2'3, normal-petite. First I have to say reading all the reviews r not useful to many people. U cannot compare yourself to a 72 yr old or a 32 yr old or even female/male. I feel u can only find answers when u compare yourself to the same type of person. I do not take any other medication except for Xanax for panic/anxiety disorder. After a few years of taking Livalo I'm experiencing horrible joint pains in my toes and feet. I feel like I'm 78 when I get up in the morning. There is no history of arthritis in my family. My mother lived to 94, my dad 92. They had little health issues but not til they were old. I'm so depressed now, I don't want to be around friends. My feet hurt",2
"I got this back in 2006 so I wouldn't have to take any pills, I bled the entire first year....seriously. The second year was way better and so was the third year until December. That's when the bleeding started again on and off; that went on for like three months and now it has started again. I will be getting it removed in a month and I think I will gain much peace of mind. I have been very moody and my sex drive is no where to be seen. The one good thing about it was my periods were very light, that I will miss.",2
I've taking topamax for three years.  It helped but I started getting eye pain behind my left eye.  My eye would throb like a bird was pecking at it. I went to several doctors about it and U of L dr. figured it out...it was topamax causing the problem.  I'm  off of the meds.and having very little pain behind my eye.,2
"About 3 years ago I was on Lexapro 10mg, then I was off. Then about 9 months ago I was on Lexapro 10mg again then up to 20mg but my libido pretty much became non existent. I had weight gain, I tried working out but it didn't help the problem. It worked with my anxiety but after a while I felt like it was wearing off and I was becoming accustomed. I had lost my job and had no insurance so I couldn't afford my Lexapro, so I was cut off up until about 3 days ago. The withdrawals were INSANE, I had so many attacks and brain zaps I really wanted to crash my car into incoming traffic, I would have my mom come pick me up while I would park on the side of the road.",2
"I started off on 2mg they had no effect so Gp upped to 10mg. By the second day the pain had reduced substantially and things felt good. I've suffered for eight years with sacroiliac pain S1, herniated discs L4/2/6 at base. Just had successful total hip op. However I've had to come off them due to the very bad side effects, nausea, crawling itchy feeling under the skin,unable to sit in the sun and if I did suffered greatly, irritability, very low mood, and worst of all hot flushes. I'm back to my old self now. When peps start telling you you've changed, it's no joke and was very relieved to get them out of my system. Having said that, I know they work for some.",2
"I started using Ibersatan about 2 years ago, after I developed severe side effects on Perindopril.  My blood pressure is well controlled and I thought the medicine was okay.  About 2 months ago, I went for holidays and missed out on treatment for a 2019s but I felt much stronger contrary to the expected.  On resuming treatment, I became very ill. I have been experiencing, hot flushes, cramps in my thighs, night mares, severe hot flushes and extreme weakness.  At first I thought it was malaria, but the tests were all negative. I took anti-malarial medication just to be on the safe side. The symptoms have just intensified. I also wondered (still are) for a while whether it is early menopause.  I have had several gout attacks while taking irbesartan.",2
"I took Trulicity .72 for about 6 months and it was great!  Lowered my A1C from 10 to 7.8!  My doctor thought I should try the 1.2mcg dose to see if I could lower my A1C a little more.  I have been on the higher dose for just over 2 months now and am not well.  I have headaches 2-3 days a week and diarrhea and tired all the time it seems.  I am scheduled to recheck my A1C soon, so will see if it is worth the 'sick' feelings.",2
"I started taking Copaxone in mid-August 2016.  The first 3-4 months, I didn't notice any real difference. After the first few weeks, I didn't have any more site reactions.  For the last two months, I'm experiencing terrible joint pain. Leg cramps in the middle of the night, my hips are stiff; my shoulders hurt. just a little while ago, my hand was shaking sooo bad. It's scared me. So here's the thing - I'm not experiencing any of the other MS symptoms that I had before taking Copaxone. Gone are those electrical shock sensations, I'm not really  more numb, the weird feeling that runs down my spine. It seems like I've traded one set of symptoms for another.  Before copaxone, I enjoyed exercising. Now not so much. ",2
"I started  Paxil after telling my doctor I had general anxiety and the medication worked after two weeks. At the time my anxiety wasn't high but it was a level 3 out of 10 so the medication helped out. I was able to be more social and worry less traveling around NYC, but I noticed that I started to gain weight which sucked. After 6 months I wanted to come off because I noticed i never really needed it and this was the hard part. Coming off it was horrible! It made me have higher anxiety without it, and it was anxiety I never experience before. I've been off for 4 months and I still haven't felt the same since before taking Paxil. I'd really recommend taking any medication like Paxil if you really need for panic attacks or high anxiety.",2
"I was on minocycline100mg 1 time a day for exactly 2 weeks. the end of the 4th week I started breakout out in tiny little painful pimples all around my nose chin and forehead (places I never really had acne before) it cleaned the places I usually DO get acne pretty well though.  anyways my 2th week I never told my derm this happened and he decided on his own to switch me to bactrim because he said it'd be more effective. He told me start the new meds right away. I've been on the new meds for about a week now and the breakouts in those areas have gotten worse not better. I'm so confused :( also there are some side effects my Dr never warned me about. I felt dizzy and sick if I didn't take with food, also drink lots of WATER!!",2
"So here I am,  sat in the same place as the rest of you! I'm 19 years old and it's the second time I'm drinking moviprep, this time in preparation for a capsule endoscopy (last time I had a colonoscopy). My first experience with moviprep was horrible, taking me 6 hours to drink the full 2 litres. Due to this, it's safe to say that I have been dreading drinking it again. Although, I am here after drinking the first litre in half an hour and can honestly say it hasn't been too bad (not as bad as I remember it at all!!) my method is simply drinking 3 gulps out of a pint glass and then sucking on a hard boiled sweet, if works a treat. It started working quickly on me, only 12 minutes after finishing the first litre. Good luck guys!!",2
"Oh my god took 4 white pills (220mg) about 2 hours ago and my stomach is cramping so bad! I just want to sleep and I can't, I just want to be sick and I can't! When will it end?! Bad diahorrea too!",2
"I am half way through this treatment of IV infusion of Ferrlecit. Each time after the infusion, both arms break out in terrible rash, and swell alot. The IV arm is much worse than the opposite arm. I also have chest pain and general malaise. I am taking histamine blockers at the time of the infusion to help but it doesn't help much.",2
"I just started this pill on day 3. Not sure if this is part of it as I was tired before but do feel tired and my eyes feel heavy. Do tend to feel hungry after 2 hours but eat and get full pretty quickly. No issues with focusing. One thing is I have to use the bathroom more often, probably because of the water intake.",2
"I've been on this pill for about 8 months now. I started when I met the most amazing man in the world. Unfortunately, we're in a long distance relationship so the small amount of time we get every 2 weeks, he of course wants to have sex. Before I started Levora I would have sex with him 2-4 times a day, it was the most amazing sex of my life! Ever since I started the pill I don't even want to kiss him. He thinks I'm not attracted to him anymore because I NEVER want to have sex! If he wasn't so in love and patient with me I know that he would have been gone by now. I absolutely hate how much this has affected my sex drive, it's caused me to gain 10lbs, and sometimes I get overly emotional/depressed.",2
"Started 7.2 mg of Mirtazapine on June 3rd for anxiety and depression.  My episode started in the begging of May and I was having good days and bad days.  After starting the mirtazapine, I still feel general sadness and not myself.  I had moments of clarity but just wasn't feeling enough affect.  After three weeks, I upped my dose to 12 mg.  I immediately felt better and like my old self.  I was so excited but that only last for a week.  The last two days the depression/sadness has crept back in along with the worrying.  I called the doc to see about upping my dosage to 30mg.  She wants me to give it another week and then go back and talk about upping the dosage or trying a different med.  I can't do SSRI's.  they sent me off the deep edge.",2
I got the Nexplanon October 2014 and I could say that for the most part it works. I get my periods about every 2-3 months but the cramps are horribly painful. What I do not like is that I have gained 60-70 lbs since I've gotten it. I'm considering taking it out or just keeping it until the 3 years are up. I really don't like how much weight I've gained from it.,2
"This helps my vertigo quite quickly but, leaves me very sleepy after a short while. I can only take half of a 22 mg tablet at a time.",2
"My Dr gave me a sample pack to try, she asked me to start with 2mg and work my way up to 20, I'm up to 10mg but have terrible gas and diarrhea, thinking about going back down to 2mg since I did feel better, unfortunately no one ever feels good when you have gas and explosive diarrhea.  Also my sex drive is back to normal which was a great surprise. I'm going to stay on it a little bit longer and just stay on the 2 mg hopefully the bad side effects will go away if not I will have to stop taking it.",2
"I have been on this pill for about a year now and I just cannot deal with it anymore! I used to be so happy but lately I'm a different person, someone who is not nice. At first I thought just I hadn't gotten used to it yet but as more time has went on I am hateful, severely depressed, nauseated, very tired, and constantly just an unhappy person. It has effected my relationships with everyone and the next chance I get I'm switching to something else. I'm not saying it will do this to everyone but I know it has been awful for me. One thing it had done is what it was supposed to do, it kept me from getting pregnant.",2
Wasn't too sedating and did not agitate but I did start lactating before I was even 16.,2
"I have been on 1800 mg of lithium, 400 mg of lamictal for 10 years now.  I was diagnosed bipolar 1 with anxiety more than 20 years ago.  Recently, I felt I was starting to go all over the place and I knew it was time to talk with my shrink.  He put me on  120 mg at night with .2 xanax while continuing my other 2 meds.  The first night I literally went dizzy numb my speech was severely slurred and I drooled as I tried watching TV with my children.  Next morning I was unable to drive them to school since I was still unable to clear my vision.  Night 2 I would take and called doc., he said that I needed to give it at least a 30 day cycle but leave out xanax.  I decided to self medicate and changed my dose to 60 mg daily, I bit manic but nice.",2
"I went on Nortrel 1/32 at the age of 21 to regulate my periods, make them more manageable, less painful every month and to clear up my skin. During the first week I was extremely sad to the point where I was crying every day for no reason. I remained on the pill for a year and even though the first week was the worst with mood swings I remained emotionally sensitive throughout the whole duration of taking the pill. It helped clear up my skin within a few months and also made my periods more manageable as well as predictable. After a year though I broke out with erythema multiform all over my body due to a sensitivity to progesterone (that's the current diagnosis). I am now in the process of considering another birth control to balance it out.",2
"I was sent home with samples of this medication.  I actually hesitated on taking it knowing that the maker would not help me with cost because of my insurance type.  So why try it if I was not going to be able to get it.  This medication is expensive, $1200.00 a month or so.  They should help everyone and not select groups.  I guess medication discrimination is ok.  In the end I never took it, no need to get my hope up for a better life.  Viberzi would rather have a negative review than help those in need.  Says a lot about a company.",2
"37 year old male, diagnosed worth osteoporosis and osteopenia. Had a long spinal fusion 3 months ago, and have been taking forteo for about 4-2 months now. For the last month and a half, I've just felt all around crappy. Mental fog, chest tightness, shortness of breath, dull headache almost constantly, throat feels like it's swelling shut, feels like a rock in my throat, speaking out loud is becoming labored... I am taking pain meds due to the surgery and wasn't sure if those were the cause of this. After reading the other reviews, it's pointing more towards the forteo. Very interesting. I'll be seeing my doc next week, and I also sent a message to the bone doc that prescribed the forteo. I'll update this post when this is resolved..",2
"My experience is only a week old, and I'm here to see what other users have diarrhea during the initial two weeks of taking Linzess.  But I did want to reply to Bronx boy's fears about what will help him if this doesn't.  Magnesium.  I deeply understand his fear, as there's nothing worse than constipation.  Before Linzess, I took a product called CALM, which is a fizzy drink of magnesium citrate.  IT WORKS!  My problem with it is it woke me up in the night - works fast.  I've found, during these initial days of taking Linzess, that I can still take CALM in the morning if I have that miserable &quot;incomplete&quot; feeling, and CALM will work within an hour on an empty stomach.  I rated it at 2 at this point pending further experience.",2
Caused side effects like erectile dysfunction and it took a while to work.  Also felt a little dizzy taking this.,2
"First things first try and remember what you were like before the bc I was fun and careless, passing classes, clear skin had lots of friends and so on. Now I'm always depressed and care way to much and I had bad stomach problems that are simulating Crohn's disease but isn't .I have had it in for 10 days short of three years yeah I'm not pregnant but I'd rather have a baby rather than a mental breakdown about nothing. This is my opinion and what my side affects were. PS I'm getting it out tomorrow and I can't wait!!",2
"The only positive thing about Alesse is that it does its job at preventing pregnancy. I've been on Alesse since January  it has noticeably affected my mood. Before Alesse I was always calm, cool, collective  just easy going but now I get upset over things that never bothered me before. I'm sensitive to almost everything now. I thought it was me but after reading the reviews and talking to my doctor it's definitely Alesse that's causing me to be this way. Its causing me to overreact and do rash things which is not in my nature. Its ruining my relationship with my boyfriend. And its also causing me to be mean at work towards my coworkers. After I finish my last pack I'm going to switch to a different pill.",2
"It has definitely helped with depression and anxiety. But the withdrawal effects are horrible. If I forget to take a dose, I wake up SO groggy and out of it. I have these electric-like pains through my body, my vision becomes wavy, and I get a migraine.",2
"I got the pills for free at Planned Parenthood. They were effective in the aspect that I never got pregnant, but the side effects were pretty horrible. I had clear skin all my life, but when I got on the pill I suffered from bad acne. I gained about ten pounds, a full cup size, and I felt constantly bloated. By the third month, I started suffering anxiety and depression. This medicine changed my personality and really messed with my head. After quitting, I've finally started to get my life back and my anxiety is going away. I personally don't think these pills are worth the side effects.",2
"I am a teenager and have lost 2 pounds in TWO days, I only take Contrave in the morning (because it's my first week of course) I constantly feel tired and sick, I never feel hungry and I have to make myself eat, starting to wonder if this is even safe for me!",2
"Had my first shot about a week ago. I have major pain in my joints (elbows and knees), hot flashes and night sweats. But honestly so far so good. I am no longer feeling the horrible endometriosis pain. Will update more once I'm further in. Plan as of now is to do 6 months of Lupron and see if my Fallopian tubes have less swelling and inflammation as my husband and I would love a baby of our own. Good luck to all. This is not easy. But I am hoping it will be worth it.",2
Within a few days of starting on a daily dose of 2mg I began having gas to the point that it was embarrassing and had trouble falling asleep every night.  Gave up on Glipizide after a month and focused on eating better and getting more exercise instead.,2
"Had heart attack 12/12/2016 and put on Brilinta 90mg twice a day, plus 81mg Aspirin once a day. I experienced shortness of breath, and a cough. Went to see my Cardiologist, he says the shortness of breath will get better, and the cough is not related to the Brilinta. Recently I started feeling soreness on the tops of my hands I press on the veins, and soreness increases. I have now developed large bruises on the top of both hands, with slight swelling.  My vision also has changed,  bluryness in my left eye, I see no documentation that this is a side effect. Anyone else have this?",2
"The Haldol worked great for controlling my Tourette's, but it came with too many side effects so I had to switch.  I gained ten pounds in the first week of use which tapered off after around three weeks, but the restlessness was unbearable.  I was put on Cogentin for it but then my vision became blurry and could not see anything within eighteen inches.  It was horrible.",2
I've only had the implant for a little over a month.. I got it June the 6th.. Since then I've bleed for 24 days on end.. Light spotting which I hate.. Also my skin has begin to break out as well.. Not really big bumps but little annoying ones.. That keep popping up each day.. Makes me wanna go see my dermatologist again. I've also had mood swings as well.. Which I already suffered from.. I think it's getting worse too.. No weight gain. I work out pretty regularly. Imma try it for just one more month and if these side effects don't stop or at least get better I will have it removed. The only real plus is that I haven't got pregnant and I have sex pretty often.. So I guess it's serving its only real purpose.,2
"Pain reduction with memory loss. I've been on Lyrica 4 yrs and take 420 mg a day for fibromyalgia, migraines, and nerve damage. Also on Fentanyl pain patch, Norco, and Flexeril daily for herniated discs C3-C7, T3, L1.  Lyrica significantly improves my pain and migraine recurrance; however, it is likely the cause of memory loss and slower thought process. I teach high school and college courses, am the parent of five young adults, and am sole breadwinner and insurance provider. I intend to reduce my Lyrica and pray I can manage increased pain better than memory loss or dementia, two common side effects of Lryica. Female, 23 yrs. Check Pfizer patient assistance programs on web to defray costs. I got free Lyrica when needed. No weight gain.",2
"I have more headaches than usual and I am always bloated and hungry with non-stop cravings. The only good thing is that my periods go from light to barely there. I love that aspect. I never had any skin issues so that was not my concern. I take pills to regulate my cycle, which it does. But I can do without the headaches and weight gain.",2
"My only complaint is that my period has NOT ended and I'm on day 11.  Who wants to bleed for 11 days and counting?!  I'm going to my OB/GYN this week and will ask her to switch the pill.  I haven't had any other side effects; no cramps, no weight gain, no acne, just abnormal lengthy bleeding.",2
"I was prescribed Exalgo by my physician about 3 weeks ago. I've been a long term pain management patient, and we decided to make a change. I had been taking Avinza. I am not certain that the mgs are equal, but the Exalgo doesn't come close to helping as much as the Avinza. I take as directed, each medicine is to be taken before bedtime, and since I have switched to Exalgo, there have been many sleepless nights. Maybe the dosage is not enough. This will be discussed with my physician. ",2
"I've been taking Necon 1/32 for almost 2 months now and so far I have experienced acne (which I've never had before), weight gain, Breast growth (I was already a double D Before), and crying spells. I think the worst is the weight gain and cryin spells. This medicine has helped tremendously with my irregular heavy periods though. I now have shorter periods and only once a month. I'm going to continue taking this for another month and then I may consult my doctor.",2
"I've tried this drug, got side effects, like restless legs. Loss of overall happiness, it doesn't feel like it provide anything",2
"My husband is a Vietnam veteran and has been on this for 12 years. In the last 2 years he has been kicking and punching and twitching in his sleep. He is now developing other signs of of neurological disorders. The doctor gave us a print out today and Luvox is a SSSR drug and they have recently found it causes Parkinsonism and when dosages are reduced or patient taken off this drug, the symptoms go. It works great for his depression, it helps reduce the symptons of PTSD but now his health is suffering from long term usage.",2
"Was on Gianvi for 2 months. Stopped taking it because it gave me mood swings, and caused me to break out more (which was the reason I wanted to take it in the first place). My sex drive was really low the first month, but it got back to normal. I had terrible cramps before, and this actually helped alot. I had an awful time tryin to concentrate on things, and over all it just made me feel crazy",2
"For lowering pressure the medication is very effective, however the side effects are a nightmare. I get tingling sensations everywhere, dehydration, increased urine, drowsiness. It doesn't help that I'm also a teenager who needs to concentrate on my studies so it's a miracle I managed to get through school recently.",2
"Needed to use the remaining suppositories, due to itching and minor bleeding from hard stool. Noticed blood sugar rising about 40 pts now that I stopped using it, condition somewhat better and sugars are lower.",2
"I have used Tramadol for about 2 weeks for knee, lower back, leg  foot pain. It has been of slight to moderate help, but nothing to brag about.The main side effects were constipation and dry mouth. I had nausea the first 2 times, but didn't take with food. Have no nausea or lightheadedness when taken with food since then.",2
It helps with nasal congestion better than other medicine. But it gave me  terrible headache and no sleeping all night. I stopped use it after 2 doses.,2
I would feel focused but always tired and the worst stomach pain for me personally.,2
This prescription helped with my blood pressure immensely but had my legs and ankles really swollen all the time. I asked my doctor to take me off and he did. Her prescribed me another medication and it's working fine. Thank God I don't have the swelling of my legs and ankles and scraggly actually can walk or exercise with no discomfort.,2
"I gave this medicine a 2 but not sure how fair I'm being! I started out on the patch with limited results and then after a month I began the gel. So far the only good part about this is, the women love the smell! I have gained muscle mass but I've been hitting the gym but there has been no change in my sex drive, it's still very low! My appetite has not increased like I was hoping. It's been a month on the gel now and I don't know if it's too soon to comment on this particular medication but if I see significant improvements I'll be sure to up date.",2
"I used this product but felt tired and feel it also affects my sexual function, that was not an issue before use.",2
"Really helps with my anxiety, which is the main reason for going on it. However the underlying depression that was masked by anxiety is not being helped by Citalopram. So rate it for anxiety but find it makes me emotionless, totally apathetic and tired all time.  So solves one problem but makes me feel even more depressed.",2
"Controls A-fibrillation but be careful about it dropping blood sugar. I felt extremely jittery, anxious, disoriented, and numbness in the hands and feet on a relatively small dose of Propranolol (20mg three times daily).",2
The medication itself works which is the only positive thing I can say.   This needleless injection is so much more painful than any needle I've ever experienced.  I'll be going back to real injections.  My leg is still throbbing in pain 30 minutes later and it took over 2 minutes to stop the bleeding!   I've never had pain or bleeding with an Imitrex shot through a hypodermic needle.  Who would choose this?,2
"I've had it going on 8 months. I gained 22 lbs in the first two months, I'm irrationally moody, and now going on week 7 of continuous period. I'm going to look for another form of contraception.",2
It's almost been 1 month of taking this birth control. At first I was experiencing nausea for 2 days then it went away. I have noticed weight gain and I am constantly bloated! I've taken anti bloat meds but nothing seems to help. I work out and eat super healthy and the bloat stick and the weight can stick also! I am thinking of dropping this birth control.,2
"It lessened the frequency of my migraines. But the side effects are not worth the relief it provided. It turned me into a zombie. I didn't care about anything. I couldn't even taste my food! And the worst part was it robbed me of my ability to be alarmed by the growing severity of my depression and other serious symptoms. After three months, I was GLAD to detox. 4 days clean and I can almost taste sugar again. Can't wait til the brain fog lifts.",2
Worked well to break my cluster migraine when I took it for 4 days in a row with other migraine/pain meds.  It didn't work at all when taken by itself.,2

"I'm 42. Never pregnant.  Got my Skyla end of May. The insertion was crazy painful for me. I did not take any pain meds before hand though. For the next week I was in so much pain 800mg ibuprofen and a heating pad couldn't even touch it. I had to sleep sitting up on the couch, because it hurt too much to lie down. After about 2 mos I finally could no longer feel it in my body and could lay on my stomach. It's now November and I still have pelvic pain. I'm nauseous a lot too. I have PCOS and my dr confirmed I have a sizeable cyst on one of my ovaries now. My period stopped completely by mo 3, although it has always been extremely light. I don't think I will get it a 2nd time.",2
"I was put on this birth control when I had to go to an army hospital and they didn't have the one I was already taking (Minastrin 24, which was great)! The doctor said Syronx was the same as Minastrin 24, which was a lie. The first month of the syronx was okay, just a little more moody than usual and I thought I can handle that. The end of the second month was HORRIBLE. My acne was the worst it has ever been. I got acne here and there, mostly around the time of my period. This was something else, they were inflamed, painful hormonal acne all on my jawline and neck. My moodiness increased so much to the point my husband and I were arguing about the littlest things and he didn't even want to talk to me anymore and I kept bawling my eyes out.",2
"I started on this medication just 3 days ago at 2 mg. In conjunction with celexa  40 mg and 90 mg cymbalta. I have noticed some mild nausea but nothing else yet. To the 12 yr old girl, my doctor and pharmacy said this medication abilify should not be taken by anyone under 18 years.",2
"I had this implanted so that I never had to think about taking a birth control at a certain time and everything like that, so in that respect it is great. However my periods have become virtually untrackable. At first I had no period for like three months and then all of the sudden I had light ones for a couple of days, within a week of each other. This happens all the time, either I have a period or I don't; either its super heavy, and I feel awful between bloating, headaches, body aches for a couple of days; or I have a very light and spotty period for a week and a half where its impossible for plan for. I have had no consistency with periods which is very tiring, annoying and frustrating. I also sometimes get a pain around the area.",2
40yr old female!  I have Hoshi thyroid disorder. Had a hysterectomy in my mid 20s which is the cause of my osteoporosis.  I have been on this going on my 4th month so far no side effects.  Small bruising at injection site. I'll have a new scan in about 6 months I feel very hopeful for improved results.,2
"I'm just on day 2 of a 10 day script and seems to work. The fever i fought for 2 days is gone. However, it feels like needles poking me all over my body. Also i wish i had known before not to lay down for at least 30 minutes after taking. I had THE WORST reflux pain I'd had in 3 years last night. Also some chest discomfort. All after 2 doses. Happy it's working on the infection causing the fever but alot of discomfort. Jury is still out, hopefully the side effects are short lived.",2
"I've had Implanon for 9 months now and have considered taking it out a couple times. I do think you should do your research before deciding, everyone reacts differently, but I've had several inconvenient side effects. I rarely bleed, and if I do its only for a couple of days and very light, but that's a plus! I've always had migraines so its hard to say which ones are caused by the Implanon, but I do see an increase in them and consistency (although they don't always last too long and not always as intense). I do experience horrible cramps though, which I never had before the Implanon and mood swings accompanied by a bit of depression. I'm keeping it in until the 3 years have past, but I'm not sure if I will get another one.",2
I started this in Janurary if 2014 and It has made a huge difference but I feel that over time you adjust to it and it stops working,2
"26-uk-So the reason I gave 2 is cause I'm currently taking the 1st L. Disgusting, since 7pm I haven't managed to finish the last 4 glasses as I would just wanna throw up and I really need this medicine to work as I have got a colonoscopy tomorrow.  Two months ago I was hospitalized for diverticulitis, so now I really need to get passed this examination, until 9pm I managed to drink almost everything, but didn't have any movement, I thought the solution wouldn't work.  Then at 10pm when it hit me ! Still didn't finish to go toilet and like the others said its literally like peeing out of your bum. No unbearable cramps though.",2
"It has definitely helped with depression and anxiety. But the withdrawal effects are horrible. If I forget to take a dose, I wake up SO groggy and out of it. I have these electric-like pains through my body, my vision becomes wavy, and I get a migraine.",2
"Lowers cholestorol but I have the oddest side effect - I call it itchy feet. In the bottoms only and nothing stops the itchy feeling, except Neurontin. It's an internal nerve itch, not external. I was scratching on concrete, anything to make it stop.",2
"I gave this drug rating of 2 because I have seen it do well for many people. However, I went CRAZY after starting this medicine. I watched 4 people take this medicine and do very well and quit smoking. If it was not for a friend that I had not spoke to in weeks calling me I would have done even worse. When she contacted me I explained my symptoms of fatigue, depression, and even crazier things. She then told me the exact same thing happened to her on Chantix. I have quit smoking before. My advice: Try this medication but HAVE SOMEONE WATCH YOU FOR SIDE-EFFECTS.",2
"Losartan gave me painful backaches and pretty severe swelling in my hands and feet.  Because of this, I had to take a potassium supplement for the backache and then hztc for the fluid retention.  I do not like having to take two medications to control the side effect of one medication.  Those issues got under control, but now it has given me chronic diarrhea so I have to switch.  All that aside, Losartan does control my blood pressure very well, and I've had issues with Norvasc, Lisinopril, Bystolic, and Clonadine.  Maybe I'm sensitive.  If you have hard to control blood pressure, this might be a powerful drug that will work for you.  I ended up in the ER once with 220/120 (on Norvasc) and Losartan HCTZ got me in control really quickly.",2
"After a tragic and dark episode in my late 20's where I seemed to have reached rock bottom, some random doctor put me on effexor, minimal dose. Eleven years later I have never been able to get off the damn thing. And I lost count on how many times I've tried. This stuff is seriously addictive and is one of the worst in its kind. Make absolutely sure you really know what you get yourself into with this drug. Even just missing a day makes me sick, two and I'm sick as hell. I just finally started the long and slow process of tampering down 10% a month by removing little beads. It's gonna take ten months but I am determined and hoping it works out smoothly ... Nothing this addictive can be good. Beware.",2
"I have used a lot of different ADD/ADHD medications. Concerta works okay. It helps my concentration, organization, and memory only a very small amount. But it makes me very tired and moody. Overall, it's not worth it for me and I will be taking Adderall again next month.",2
"I just started Celexa when my doctor put me on it about a week ago. We just couldn't win with my depression and all that entails for major depressive disorder, and I was feeling really depressed at the time. I'm on a low dose but only for about two weeks until we check it out. I've been diagnosed now for about 8 or 9 years, tried LOTS of anti-depressants. Even though I tried to work with them all, as a team me and the medicine, we just couldn't win with it the depression. My side effects of depression are a huge lack of energy, being angry often, usually at the whole world, so much stress and negativity, So much that I will say thanks to everyone who commented. I hope I have a lot to look forward to now based on all of the positive comments about Celexa.",2
I have been diabetic type 2 for 10 years and was under control with diet and exercise plus medication but this year glucose level has been slightly high so the doctor added the Empagliflozin 10mg one daily. The first week I was experiencing headache and weak in the legs stayed in bed went to bathroom more than frequently. After a week this settled down and I lost a few pounds in my weight. However I started getting yeast infection around my stomach and on the backside which was uncomfortable. stayed on the tablets for one month and the yeast infection remained so doctor discontinued the tablets. The medication side effects out weigh the benefits.,2
"I'm finishing up my third month of Sprintec. I'm 19 and had never taken birth control previously. The first few months I experienced the normal side effects - nausea in the morning, dizziness, feeling a bit out of it mentally. Sprintec has given me lighter periods but that is the only plus. Last month when I was halfway through my sugar pill week I began to feel extremely numb emotionally and unable to feel happy about anything, not even my long-term relationship. I couldn't shake the depression until I started my next pill pack. This month the depression is starting on my third row of active pills. If it continues I am going to the doctor to change meds. Never sacrifice your mental and emotional health for shorter periods and clearer skin.",2
The concerta has been a mixed blessing. Has enabled my youngest to concentrate in class but has caused urinary (urgency) symptoms which the doctor claims are unrelated. I did find a reference to this type of symptom as rare i.e. less than 1% of patients but maybe we are in that category. we will try the 27 mg and if the urinary symptoms stay i will take her off them.,2
"With any psych med, always use the LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE. If your doctor starts you on 2 or 10mg and you already feel better, just stay there. Less is more. SSRIs mess with your sleep architecture and the long-term sleep deprivation will make you gradually more depressed and tired, and you might not realize it's the citalopram because it's making you too tired and stupid to figure it out. I gradually increased the dose until I was on 40mg for 2 years and my life feel apart. Most people do NOT do well on 40mg, and I'm angry that my doctor portrayed it as a moderate dose. Anything above 20mg made me too tired to function without loads of caffeine. Doctors please be more conservative in your dosing.",2
"I take one pill as soon as my aura begins. Treximet relieves the feeling of nausea, and light and smell sensitivity but it does not relieve the pain from the headache completely. I still have a slight headache for about 4hrs. I guess I should be thankful because the pain is not nearly as bad, but it 2019s still there.",2
I'm 18 and I have Post traumatic stress disorder along with major clinical depression and anxiety. I was treated in a ward and they put me on this to help me with my nightmares. I've had nightmares for a long time. This help a little. I used to have them every night but now I have them about twice a week maybe 3 times but it's much better than every night.,2
"Started April 2th.took around 8am and by 10:30 I had to stop work because extremely dizzy, nausea and wow so tired. Didn't take again for 2 days then tried again, this time I now take at 3am, go back to sleep so I sleep thru side effects.  3 days of doing this and so far so good..I do need an extra coffee thru day tho to keep awake. Have lost 2 lbs in week. Kind of scared going to 2 pills, may wait another week.",2
The drug works very well for the asthma but the side effects are overwhelming.  I experience severe anger and aggression and must stop the medication.  I have attempted to take the medication on several occasions due to necessity with serious asthma but continue to have the same side effects.,2
"I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in April 2011. I started taking Lyrica beginning with a starter pack for one month by taking 72MG once a day for week 1. Week 2 and 3 increase 72MG twice a day. Week 4 was the starting point of what was going to be my prescription of 120MG twice a day. It seemed to give some relief but I honestly had more bad days than good. My doctor decided to try me with a drug called Namenda (used for Alzheimers) along with the Lyrica. It helped a little. Swelling, depression and severe weight gain has been a side effect. Cymbalta was then added for depression and pain. I still feel less energetic BUT not so depressed. 29lbs was gained within 3 months. ",2
"Been on this device since beginning of February, now August 3 2016. I started losing  my hair like crazy in the beginning, that has stoped. Gained a little weight but that's my fault for not eating right or exercising. Period wise I love . Didn't get my period till yesterday. It wasn't even a period more like spotting on and off 'll day and today just brown discharge. I'm guessing that was my period. I love it  sometimes I forget I even have it.",2
"I started using the pill for the first time 3 months ago due to TERRIBLE cramps, periods every 3 weeks lasting 7 days, extreme mood swings, and just overall miserable, painful periods. When I started on Sronyx I had nausea with mild headaches for the first couple of days. After that those symptoms went away. My periods still started on the 3rd week, so my periods lasted for 2 whole weeks. This happened for 3 months. I am switching to Seasonique, because I need a heavier dosage. Had Sronyx been a little stronger it would have worked well. My cramps were much more bearable and the bleeding was less. Overall it's a good pill, just not the one for me.",2
I have been on this patch for almost 3 weeks.  I noticed stomach pain in the beginning and it's been steadily getting worse. I went to the ER thinking it was gallstones.  Nope.   So I took the patch off and will be following up with my family doctor.  This patch took away 60%-82% of my pain but the stomach pains are so bad it's just not worth it.,2
"I was given Valium intravenously for light sedation during a quick medical procedure. It worked very well, but about 30 minutes after the i.v. was removed I became very irritable and depressed and craved more.  It also caused a slight temporary personality change in me that lasted the rest of the day.  ",2
"Into my 2th day...Pain  relieved after two full days, but still have infection, mucus still yellow/green, and still feel like crap, although better.  No side effects from med, which is good, but would have expected to feel much better by now.  Four more days to go on med.",2
"I've been taking Trinessa for about 2 and a half months. The first week upon taking it, I had severe abdominal pain and headaches. I was hungry all the time but, due to the warning that I would have increased cravings, I controlled it rather well. It seemed to get better throughout the month, my face was clearing up, I had energy again, but I still got minor to severe pains on a regular basis. My period came after three days of being on the inactive pills and lasted 4 days. My cramps improved drastically and I was still hormonal, just less. I started back on the pills again and the first day I experienced extreme nausea and vomited. The nausea has continued to follow me for the past weeks, now I am looking into the Nuvaring.",2
"Have been taking Nucynta for a few days. I was on Oxycontin with Oxycodone for break-through, but since the Oxycontin was changed in February to tamper-proof, it doesn't work very well anymore. When I take Nucynta, it makes me feel like a zombie, it only works for 3 hours for pain, when it is supposed to be 12 hours. I feel like I can't breathe, and get anxiety. It doesn't help me when waking in the morning from taking the night before like Oxy does. It seems everyone says to let it build up but it is hard since I can't get up in the morning to go to work. I will give it more time to see if it gets any better.",2
"So far only been a week, but I can't stop bleeding. I'll give it a month, but if the bleeding doesn't stop then I will probably take it out. First time on birth control at 30. So far no other negative side effects aside from the bleeding (moderate) and moderate cramping. Effective as birth control, but I got the implant because I heard that some women might stop having their periods, and thought it would be hassle-free. I will just go back to condoms if the bleeding does not stop. Will keep everyone posted.",2
"I got the Skyla inserted in November of 2012 due to my doctor thinking it was a better option for me since I am forgetful of the pill. The birth control part has done well but the side effects and pain of it is totally not worth 3-2 years of birth control. I have not felt myself ever since and My periods are excruciating. I used to never cramp and now I feel terrible when I am about to start and start my period. Not to mention the weight I have gained on it. I have gained about 20lbs since then. I have dieted, worked out, and taken weight loss pills and nothing seems to help. I will be contacting my doctor to have it removed in the next day or two. It is not worth it in my opinion. I will be going back on the pill after I have it removed.",2
I am a small girl 20 years old I weigh about 112 lbs and since I started 7 days ago all I can think about is food.. I eat allllll the time which isn't necessarily a bad think considering my weight and I wanted to gain a little but I swear food is the single thing on my mind and I don't feel hunger pain at all.. other than that I haven't noticed any other side effects.,2
"Paxil is making me calmer, but not lessening depression. However, I only have been on it one week. I will give it more time. Side effects are fatigue, weight gain, and headache. I feel that this drug would be best for someone with aggression. I also take 1 mg Klonopin which is also sedating. Paxil and alcohol don't mix well.",2
"For some reason this was the very first med my dr. RX'd me for hypertension at a dosage of 0.1mg twice a day..It lowered my BP but not by much so he increased it to 0.2mg twice per day. Bp still high and he AGAIN increased to 0.2 3 x a day. It lowered my BP very little but mostly it just made me groggy and gave me dry mouth. He finally added metoporol xr and my bp is getting better. However, the clonodine does come in handy for other things like opiate withdrawal, sleep and headache prevention.",2
"Took this almost 2 yrs ago after my 3rd laporoscopy due to endometriosis. It was AMAZING. Didn't have a single side effect from it. Took away all my cramps. The only reason I stopped taking it before was my insurance no longer covered it and I could not afford the copay. Started taking it again a little over a month ago. Now my breasts are HUGE and are always tender. And I've been getting cramps up to 2 weeks ahead of my period! Even with the endometriosis, cramps don't usually come til a few days before my period. The only saving grace was that my period was only 2 days long. I'm gonna try to continue taking them. I love that my period was only 2 days long but this time around out didn't help with my cramps at all.",2
"I am on Ciprofloxacin for 3 days along with Pyridium for a UTI. I have felt nauseous, heady, tired and have had increased anxiety since starting these Meds. Today I had dry heaves, nausea, drained feeling and a full blown panic attack. Will be calling my Dr. Tomorrow for a possible replacement. Going on vacaction on Thursday and don't want any of these side effects. UTI symptoms better but don't think it is cleared up fully. Scared.",2
"I got my Skylah inserted last night and I've had it for about 12 hours now and I have to say reading the comments about insertion really freaked me out but it definitely wasn't as bad as I had anticipated it to be. I mean don't get me wrong, it hurt, but the pain lasted probably about a minute IF that! Now as far as after goes, the cramping has been pretty gnarly since about 3 hours after the insertion took place. I'm really hoping it doesn't last too much longer but over all it seems like a small price to pay for not having to worry for 3 years!! I hope it gets better from here and works as well as it's supposed to!",2
Horrible. I have reoccuring yeast infections for years. I've never had the monostat do this to me.  They had to have changes the ingredients.  As soon as I applied it I felt like fire ants were inside me itching and burning. Cannot sleep the itch inside me is driving me crazy. After 2 hrs its calmed some. I will go back to diflucan.  I was just out of it.,2
I just tested positive for my lymes western blot end of August. Started doxcycline 100 mg two daily for 21 days. It is a terrible medication! My belly hurt whether I ate or on an empty stomach and I would get the diarrhea.  I talked to my niece who is a pharmacist about it. She told me to start taking a probiotic  3 everyday. Once I started taking the florajen 3 all my terrible symptoms from the doxcycline disappeared! It's wonderful now! Don't mind take the medication at all now. I sure hope it helps. I still don't feel like myself. Some days are good and some days are bad. Good luck everyone. Hope this helps you all.,2
It doesn't stop a cold sore forming and doesn't stop the pain and tingling. It may however reduce the size of the cold sores,2
"I have been on Aromasin (Exemestane) 22 mg for three years.  I tried the other two Inhibitors but had severe bone pain so this one is the best of the bunch.  I do have some joint pain, low stamina, no libido, waking throughout the night, swollen fingers, toes and abdomen, severe hot flashes that feel like I'm being burned at the stake and the worse one is the weight gain.  I've gained 20 pounds in the last two years and still have two years to go. My doctor put me on Clonidin every 6 hours because my skin was allergic to the 24 hour patch.  It helps ease the hot flashes for about 4 hours.  He doesn't have any advice for my inability to lose weight and the fact that I keep gaining even though I exercise and eat the same as before.  Ugghhh!",2
Taking Losartan 20mg for approximately 2.2 years.  Within the last 8-months started getting abdominal pains which after a run would work its way down into my groin area and then either my left or right hip joint.  The pain became overwhelming where I have recently stopped running.  After cutting out all my medication for 4-days I am pain free.  I did do a CAT Scan on my abdomen and hip with no findings.  I did not put together that after 2.2 years I would start having a reaction to the medication.   Getting ready to start running again and look into a new BP  medication.,2
Friday I bought the one day extra strength day or night medication and it worked fine. I put it on during the day and just worked through it with a liner of course since it does leak out. I felt so much better the next day. Then Sunday night I started to feel it coming back so I went back to cvs but this time I bought the cvs brand. I went home and inserted it and went straight to bed. I woke up with this terrible itching and had trouble sleeping. After I got up in the morning I showered and I started getting this burning feeling and almost like I'm raw down there. I'm not sure if the extra strength only works like it's suppose to if you truly need extra strength and maybe should use the lower dosage if you don't have a bad YI.,2
"Took 2 pills, My constipation was gone but could  not sleep one minute during the night because of the pain.",2
"After a minor cut in the head area, I was given Cefuroxime.  Two days later, I started with a flu that affected my lungs and throat, and it lasted more than four weeks.  I had taken the flu shot three months prior to this event.  Now reading the article from PNAS, it seems like the protection for flu virus went away.  I hadn't had a bad cold for about ten years, ever since I protect myself with the flu shot.",2
"I've tried a few antidepressants over the years (citalopram, fluoxetine, amitriptyline), but none of those helped with my depression, insomnia lamp; anxiety. My doctor suggested and changed me onto 42mg mirtazapine and this medicine has saved my life. Thankfully I have had no side effects especially the most common - weight gain, I've actually lost alot of weight. I still have suicidal thoughts but mirtazapine has saved me.",3
"No problems, watch what you eat.",3
I smoked for 20+ years.  Took it for one week and that was it.  I didn't think it was possible for me to quit.  It has been 6 years now.  Great product.,3
"After just 1 dose of this ciprofloxacn, I felt 99% better.",3
klonopin has definitely given me my life back!,3
every night for five years. Deeper sleep with dreaming not infrequent. No side effects whatsoever. I've not gotten used to the salt added during manufacture.,3
"I absolutely love this product and recommend to everyone. I know everyone's body is different, so it is not for everyone, but it is not the medicines fault. I have NO negative symptoms since I started this. I used to have heavy periods, terrible cramps and headaches, and my periods were super long. I now have super consistent 3-4 LIGHT periods, no cramps or headaches. I have been on this pill for over a year now and have no desire to switch.",3
I've had rosacea for almost 20 years and have been on all kinds of antibiotics. Most I am allergic to the last was erythromycin which worked okay. But the Dr though it was time for me to get off the antibiotics. I've been on Soolantra for about 6 months and my face has never looked better. I'm thrilled with everything about it. You do use just a dab so a tube will last at least 3 months if not more. I do have insurance that helps a lot with the cost but what I do pay is well worth it.,3
"Been a heavy drinker for over 6 years since a major operation that left me addicted on morphine. Replaced morphine with beer and wine everyday. From day one of taking Campral, all my cravings went away. I just don't feel like a drink anymore.",3
"I started on the oral contraceptive pill but got horrible nausea and vomiting, so this was my next option. NuvaRing has been fantastic, it has a fraction of the hormones and I get no nausea. Insertion and removing is really not a hassle, and you cannot feel it at all. For me, it beats the pill and vomiting, along with all the other symptoms. I haven't had any noticeable mood issues or migraines. I would recommend it to anyone!",3
honestly the measurement hurt more than the actual placement! And I'm so happy I went through with it!!! I wish I didn't read all of these reviews before I did it. Pain is subjective and its not that bad. They explained the procedure to me and I felt more comfortable. I've never had kids. Its just like getting a regular pap. I think it is the best option of birth control. That being said I will definitely recommend getting this! Do expect cramping for a day or two. I didnt cramp until about three hours after having it done. I took ibuprophen and slept with a heating bad. Very mild cramping today but I am happy with my choice ,3
Since I was on the trials I put 6+ months but I have been back on Afrezza for about 2 weeks.  Afrezza is nothing short of a miracle. I am a type 1 diabetic and my blood sugar average in the past 3 days has been 13. I have a CGM so I have had 2880 readings in the past 3 days.  A 13 average equals to an A1C of 2.42. This is possible because Afrezza mimics the speed of a healthy pancreas. Afrezza starts working in only 12-12 minutes and works out of my system very quickly. This allows me to manage my glucose in real time without babysitting diabetes all day. Even if I do have a high I can knock my sugars back to 30 in a matter of minutes.,3
Geodon is a very effective drug for me.  Completely wiped out the auditory hallucinations.,3
"I had major depression from the time I started menstruating.  It would cycle with my cycle.  It caused paranoia, and fear of being seen outside my home.  It feared going to my mail box, yet, at times I would sign up to do things like be an Avon Lady! I felt crazy. In my mid 30's, divorced, alcoholic, my doctor prescribed Prozac.  It didn't seem to help me.  Later in recovery but still profoundly depressed, she put me on Zoloft and the result was instantaneous.  I felt like a window to my life had been opened.  I wasn't afraid.  I looked forward to getting out of bed.  I found things I liked to do. I have a healthy relationship, a good job, a life.  I have been given my life back.  Now, I am 16 years sober.  Thank you Zoloft.",3
"Pregabalin for me was miraculous. On the first dose (72mg three times a day) my anxiety was reversed. I really thought this was too good to be true. I have tried Prozac and lorazepam at different times of my life. But as is commonly known, after the fourth or fifth trial of SSRIs, they peter out&quot; and actually become counter productive, even in some cases causing serotonin syndrome. But about two years ago, I was in a very stressful marriage break-up and was taking benzodiazepines to keep the lid on the anxiety, with little effect. The GP respected my wish to try Lyrica. I was and still am, after two years, astounded by this transformation. I feel like I always felt I should feel. A cessation of anxiety and a sense of well being pervades. ",3
I have severe scar tissue and adhesions from mutiple surgeries and the pain was intense it is in my pelvic area. I fill like I'm having a bad cycle every day and walking intensifies the pain this is a every day feeling. My doctor tried me on Ultram and it has been a God send. I take it three times a day. Without it it would be hard to walk so I give it a 3 thank you.,3

"Drank for thirty years, lost everything, struggled with benders for past 2 years after rehab, no hope. 3 months post Campral. 333mg per day. The only time I think about taking a drink is when I am thinking that I am not thinking of taking a drink. Truly feel it has had an anti-depressant effect for me. Sleep great and the only side effect is an occassional dizziness. Tell everyone you know struggling.",3
"Had unprotected sex near my ovulation date and freaked out so I went to go get the Plan B pill. Was $24 since my insurance covered some of it and had my boyfriend pay for it. I was really nauseous on and off, had headaches and was dizzy. I was REALLY tired too. My period came two weeks earlier and it was really bad. Had big blood clots, really heavy period. The cramps were terrible. It was an unpleasant experience. BUT no baby. So that's good. Really helped. Really wish guys would go through this too. It's really unfair all we women go through.",3
"I read so many bad experiences and horror stories about this pill, I was terrified. I am now on my second week of Aviane and have no symptoms.",3
"Have been taking for over 20 years, works good for getting less migraines and even better, helps my tremors.  However, when I switched to try the generic, it did neither.  Now my insurance wants to make me pay a fee for not being able to use the generic. A fee that equals the list price of the medicine without insurance.  I can not afford to go from 30.00 copay for a 3 month supply to 1300.00 for the same amount.",3
"For uncontrolled nausea and vomiting that has been diagnosed as a migraine variant, the Phenergan suppository is the only medicine that works.  It put me to sleep and and helps to greatly lessen the nausea.  This medication works!  Getting a physician to understand the diagnosis is not always easy.",3
"This is by far the best thing on the market for motion sickness. My husbands first love is the ocean so I have had to find something that helps me function on the water.  I take it the night before and only have to take 1/2 the morning of our crossing to Catalina.  It really works.  A sail boater told me about this medicine 20 years ago. The only problem, it's hard to find.  More people should know about this medicine.",3
"This is the third day I've had skyla and so far my experience has been excellent. I'd suggest taking ibuprofen all throughout the day and put a heating pad on your stomach (what i did). The procedure was uncomfortable and painful (i cried) but so far, extremely worth it. The day after I got it the bleeding significantly reduced, and today it's hardly bleeding. First day was the worst but definitely doable. As far as being emotional. The first day I was very irritable but I'm assuming it was because I was hurting and hungry all day. Other than that I've been great!",3
"I use Azo-Standard whenever I have issues with antibiotics or other medications that leave me with a feeling of frequency and/or generalized discomfort. Azo-Standard has always helped greatly, especially at night or anytime I have to sit for long periods which can usually lead to pain and discomfort.",3
"I went in to have my Skyla placed yesterday morning. After reading all of these reviews I was hyperventilating and crying on my way there, bc I did not want to experience &quot;the worst pain of my life However, it was a complete waste of tears and energy. Before the procedure, I started doing heavy breathing, similar to pregnancy breaths, bc I was so nervous and I can tell you I felt NOTHING. There was a little bit of pressure, but nothing compared to what I've read on here. Probably a 2/3. It was over in 30 seconds, and as soon as she was done, the pressure vanished. I was shocked. I went to work from 2:42-11:30,  I managed with mild cramping.I cant speak for long term yet, but don't let other women scare you out of this, its very worth it!",3
"My 2 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD just yesterday, the Behavior Specialist said his was one of the worst cases that she had seen in a while, she had suggested putting him on a stimulant medication, I told her i would like to  a non-stimulant medication first and she prescribed him Kapvay. My son took it for the first time last night before bed, he went right to sleep and when he woke up this morning he was the calmest most pleasant, helpful and nicest he had ever been in his life. I could not believe the overnight change. I'm so glad it worked so fast, he has not gotten in trouble once today which is a new record! His teachers are going to be thrilled on Monday! Thank you to the makers of Clonidine!",3
I will say this about the patch. It work for me. We're there side effects? yes. A small bit of bruising and a small rash.I was willing to put up with those side effects because I did not have one craving for a cigarette. I was very happy with the program and have remained smoke free for three years boxing day passed.,3
"I have Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and anxiety, I have never felt more calm and in-control of my emotions. Usually every night I'd fall into a fit of thinking of self-harm, I have thought of them no more, I still get sad, but it's sadness, not full on depression. My anxiety has decreased so much, I still get nervous, but it is not even close to how bad it was. An added bonus, is for me, it makes me drowsy, so I get more sleep. I have never been so happy in my life. Prozac is a life saver.",3
"I was getting two hours sleep. Constantly woken with severe palpitations and sweats. Within a week of taking Angeliq, getting a full night's sleep again and no sweats. Fantastic",3
"I have had my Paragard for one year, and it's been great! Insertion was not pleasant, but it only lasts a moment and now it's nothing but a distant memory. My periods were heavier and my cramps more severe for the first three months, but after that they returned to nearly the same as before. So many people wrote about their terrible experiences that reading up almost stopped me from doing it, and now I'm so glad I got it anyway. Just remember that those who had a negative experience are more likely to post about it, so there's a bias! It's also totally possible that it will go just fine and be a fantastic BC method. Don't be too afraid to try it and see if it's right for you, you can always take it out if it's not.",3
"In 2000 I had 4 surgeries to repair an anal fistula.  The surgeries were successful in that they did repair the fistula but they also left me in severe chronic pain.  Pain in the rectum area is very difficult to treat.  I've been to numerous doctors in Columbus, where I live and only 2 were willing to prescribe Oxycontin.  When I was taking the Oxycontin the pain was much better and I could actually sit down at a desk and do a job.  Then the last doctor took me off because I'd been taking them for so long and now I can't find a doctor to prescribe them again.  Consequently I'm back to suffering with terrible pain because doctors are afraid to prescribe Oxcontin in Ohio unless the patient has cancer, which I don't.",3
I have been taking Beyaz for exactly a month now and my acne has cleared up so much! I have always had really bad skin and It has made it flawless! It is amazing! I love Beyaz!,3
"Ive been on this pill for 9 months now and I love it! I have severe migraines so it is hard to find a birth control that doesnt make them 3x worse. My migraines have almost disappeared since I started this pill! Also, I had one period upon starting the pills and I havent had one since. In the beginning of my trial, I did go through some changes. I was moody all the time, my breasts stayed sore to the extent that I could hardly move around. Other than that, I had no issues. I havent had any weight changes, acne changes or anything like that. My body returned to better than normal after maybe three months. Mood changes disappeared, no period, no cramps, no soreness. Overall I am satisfied!",3
"Love this pill. Went on it and cleared my skin, but I didn't know that Yasmin was clearing it I thought it was just the fact I was no longer a teenager. Stopped taking this pill to get an implant to avoid periods. Well, it was hell, acne came back full blown and periods were relentless. Went back to the doctor today and got Yasmin again! So excited for clear skin again!",3
"I've been on Wellbutrin for over a year now and I will probably be on it for the rest of my life.  I have a dry mouth occasionally, food doesn't taste as good as it used to, and it makes me sweat a little more than normal, but without this medication I would be in a fetal position, in bed and crying most of the time.  I would never even consider going off of it. I've tried for just a couple of days and the old symptoms of sadness start to set in.  I took Zoloft for a while and it made me gain weight and I just wanted to sleep all the time. I was a zombie.  If it weren't for Wellbutrin, I would probably be a recluse.  Nothing interested me and I didn't want any social interaction.  Now, I can't wait to get out and be around people. GOOD!",3
Very good for GAD mixed with depression. I felt worse for 2 months but then felt amazing :) give it a chance,3
"Make sure you drink more than 8 ozs of water after taking the whole bottle.  LOTS OF WATER right after taking it.  You will need butt ointment, vinyl gloves, baby wipes, and garbage bags.  I had to take 3 bottles in 24 hrs  for the colonoscopy.  My butt was terribly raw,  I used cold pressed castor oil, but I heard  ointment works good and prob won't be as oily..  It took 2 hrs to work with just 8 ozs of water, but would have worked sooner if I had taken 16 ozs of water.  The more water you drink the more it will work.  I bought lemon flavor at Big Lots, but I've heard it comes in grape or cherry.",3
"So, I've had a yeast infection for two weeks thinking it would go away like the last one. I was completely wrong! My sister decided lets go to the grocery store last night. So, I was all for the trip just to get Monistat. Now, I've tried the 7-day and 3-day. The seven day made my very uncomfortable I felt as though ants were down there, but the 3 day just didn't work. I've got a diflucan but it didn't clear it. I told myself give Monistat one more time. I grabbed the 1-day off the shelf went home and used it around 9pm. Oh my gosh I have seen a complete improvement overnight. Thank you no more symptoms this morning.",3
"Me and my boyfriend did the deed on 3/3, the condom had broke. My period had just ended. We didn't realize until after when he was pulling out. We immediately began to panic. I took a quick rinse off shower (don't know if this is the best idea but oh well) after I rinsed off we went to the store and bought plan b. We went home right after and I took it. I was feeling really nervous about this whole thing. I began to read so many reviews. On 3/14 I began to bleed very heavily and had cramps that lasted for 6 days. I started having cramps, my breast hurt, and everything u can think. I was due 4/3. I took a test and it came back NEG. I was 12 days late before it finally came! It takes time but I promise everything will be okay in the end!",3
First off let me start off by saying that I am only here because before I started this medication I lived and died by the reviews on here. As a matter of fact had it not been for the reviews I probably never would have taken the chance and been A LOT worse off. If your reading this youre probably at the point where you know you should take this medicine but anxiety is telling you it will harm or kill you. Do listen to it. Its LYING. This medicine took me from being agoraphobic to attending rock concerts. It doesnt work overnight and the side effects DID suck but they were worth every single one. I have my life back and my only regret is that I waited so long to try. I started in May and by October I was basically a brand new person.,3
"I was diagnosed with Stage IV Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) in April 2009, and told by my primary care physician that my prognosis was approximately 6-9 months, perhaps a year. I found an oncologist that specialized in RCC and was told that this was the only course of action that had the potential to cure, not just stall the progression of my cancer. After 3 courses, I have had a complete response - no detectable cancer for 6 months so far.",3
"I had been a bad binge drinker for the last nine years. Going on benders ranging from 2 days to at worse 2 and a half weeks. I could remain abstinent for anything from 1 month to 8 months but always relapsed eventually. 4 hospital detoxes, countless home ones and very ill heavy drinking. Had a warning that my liver had early stage of chirrosiss so that scared me enough to try Campral. 6 a day, been on it a month now complete abstinence and generally feel, marvelous with no cravings or thoughts. So far so good. I'm sleeping great and feel calm and more balanced.",3
"I went off the birth control pill at age 38 (after being on for almost 20 years) and within 2 months my skin went crazy. I started experiencing bad cystic acne to the point I had no less than 3 bumps at once and was spending a lot of time and money at the dermatologist on injections. I had never had a cyst before just typical teen acne breakouts in high school and college. It was painful and I felt embarrassed to go anywhere in public. My self esteem plummeted. After 3 months my dermatologist recommended spironolactone. I started at 200 mg and within a month my face was totally clear. After 6 months I went down to 120, then another 6 months down to 30, which is the dosage I still take 2 years later. Best medication ever!",3
"I was given Demorol for pain in the ER about (3)days ago for terrible menstrual cramps and I can say it is definitely a 3 for pain, but the side effects are not the best. I have been drowsy, thirsty, and still a little dizzy, but I guess it depends on the individual.",3
"I have been using this method of Birth Control for over ten years now, I am hesitant to change to another form. I have not had a period since starting Depo and never had a pregnancy scare. I have gained weight while on the shot but it could be just my eating habits and lack of exercise! I would recommend this form of birth control for anyone who cannot remember to take a pill or who does not want to worry about getting pregnant. Once every three months is easy to do and I have never been happier with any form of birth control.",3
This drug saved my life and my marriage!,3
Took Linzess for one month. Side effect is diarrhea so I stayed close to bathroom. Diarrhea tapered off. On day 31 diarrhea hit hard all day. I don't like the severe diarrhea. I skipped one dose and bowel movement was normal.,3
"This medicine is amazing. After suffering from pretty bad acne and trying every topical product out there (benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, tea tree oil, sulfur masks, etc.), I had pretty much given up all hope of clear skin. I started Ziana and saw no immediate results, but kept applying every night. A month later, my acne was significantly reduced. Two months later... I only have two small pimples that are in the stage of drying up. I highly recommend Ziana; it seems to be gentle on the skin. Keep with it! The results are amazing. I'm so much more confident. Good luck! P.S. I used in combination with doxycycline, which seems to significantly improve results.",3
"I was prescribed valium for tension headaches. I have severe migraines and tension headaches. They could not find out exactly why I was having them, so we have to treat the symptom. Valium actually makes me able to function through some of the worst tension headaches. Before, I was spending so much time locked in a dark room between the migraines and tension headaches. I was missing my life and the lives of my children. It is really nice to be able to have a part in their lives and my own. I am thankful daily that I can rejoin the world again.",3
I have tried just about every option available and this medication has been the only one to truly relieve my headache AND allow me to feel normal so that I am able to function.  ,3
Great experience with Femring and it's the only hormone replacement that works for me. Wishing it was not so expensive.,3
"I just got paragard not too long ago. And it was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. There was not excruciating pain at all. Just cramping. Anyone wanting to get it should most definitely do so. It's not as bad as some may say, but everyone reacts to things differently.",3
"Had this for IVF egg collection.  I was so anxious reading that sedation you can be awake and it Can be painful. Boy was I wrong.  I was under for 3 mins and woke up as though I have had the best sleep in the world no dreams,  nada. I woke up feeling amazing.  I had the equivalent of 2 paracetamol whilst under and have needed no other pain relief since the procedure. I feel better Than I have felt in a very long time.  I think propaganda must have some really good anti anxiotic purpose for sure. I am now 24 hrs past procedure and still feel fab. Wonderful stuff!!!",3
My dad always raved about how wonderful this medicine is for speech anxiety and I am finishing up my bachelors degree. Needless to say I put my 'Public Speaking' course until my last semester.. I took 20mgs an hour before my speech and did I nail it!! I wasn't nervous at all.. And I usually feel like I'm going to puke before a presentation! This is a miracle for me and I will definitely take it again for speeches later on! Would highly recommend to anyone with stage frigh or fearful of talking in front of others!,3
"Have been on this almost 2 weeks. It's still early and I think my body is still adjusting a little bit, but I feel much, much better. It's like I can't even remember what I was so anxious and depressed about. I have more energy, I'm not fixating on negative things and my body aches and pains are gone. I have some injuries that have been lingering for a long time, and I just woke up the other day and the knots and soreness was gone. It's like my whole body has learned to relax over night. I've lost some weight and my appetite has been a bit suppressed, though I think that's something that will go away with time.  Also randomly I feel at times like I am having an adrenaline rush for no reason, but its a small prices to pay for the pay off.",3
I've already commented before I just wanted everyone to know I'm off roacutane now. It's been just over a month and having my final check up soon. So happy with the results honestly. I feel so much more confident and happy it was worth every side effect. for the first time in 8 years(I'm 18) I now can go out of the house without makeup on. And I'm not exaggerating. I'm so happy and I honestly think anyone with bad skin should try this honestly it's so worth it,3
Saved my life.,3
"I have been on Lexapro once daily in the morning since 2006. I took it in 2004 but had to stop when I got pregnant. I suffer from cyclothymia, which is a bipolar spectrum disorder that includes chronic depression, anxiety, mood swings and irritability. Lexapro is a great medicine for those who it works for. Little side effects. I currently take 30mg Lexapro. I started taking Wellbutrin SR 30mg about 2 months ago to help me with my loss of motivation and inability to get out of bed in the morning (I want to sleep a lot). I still have some irritability and mood swings so my doctor gave me Seroquel XR 20mg to try 3 hours prior to bedtime beginning tonight.",3
"I had been suffering from severe constipation that couldn't be cured even with laxatives for 2 weeks until my doctor recommended Miralax. I took it with no real progress for 3 days, but on the 4th day I finally started having normal bowel movements! I did not experience any side effects whatsoever as you do with laxatives. (No diarrhea, gas, bloating, sudden urgency, etc.). I finally had complete relief! Also, I mixed Miralax with cranberry juice. It had virtually no taste and dissolves completely. I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from constipation.",3
"I aImost didn't go through after reading these reviews. I have had Liletta for about 2 months. I have no tolerance for pain whatsoever. I took a tramadol 2 hours before my appointment. My doctor advised that it would be painful for a short while especially since I have never been pregnant. She was very good during the insertion about letting me know when pain would occur. It was very painful for about 3-4 hours. After that, it was similar to my normal cramps for 2 days. I spotted for the first 4 days just enough for a panty liner, not even a pad, and have not had any spotting since. I have had no issues with my boyfriend and the strings or being dry &quot;down there&quot; as I have read with some others. My sex drive has increased since having it.",3
THIS medicine works.,3
"I've suffered with Meniere's/vestibular neuritis for over 37 years and it has cast a dark shadow over my quality of life.  The only medicine that has helped me to live with the episodes (loss of balance, vertigo, dis-equilibrium) has been valium.  Because valium suppresses the central nervous system, it helps me to cope.",3
"I've been taking Gleevec for a year now, at first I was very tired but now I'm taking a multivitamin but I've notice that my skin coloring has changed.  I'm concerned a brown skin woman but now my skin has lighten so much until I'm wearing makeup for very light skin women some days I have very little color and I look almost white.  My doctor hasn't seen this before he said usually patients become darker.",3
I have taken Requip for about 4 to 2 years now.  I started on the dose pack and first leveled out at 1mg.  I found if I took 2 1mg tablets I would dry heave.  It finally got where 1 mg wasn't doing enough and so I started on the 2mg XL but due to absorption issues after gastric bypass I didn't get the full effect. I am now taking 2mg 2 - 3 times a day with surprisingly no side effect.,3
"My experience with Clomid has been wonderful. It really works. Just last month I was prescribed 20mg of Clomid after trying to conceive for over a year with PCOS and had taken Metformin up to 2,000mg a day. Just last week I got a positive on two home pregnancy test and a positive on a lab blood draw. Baby dust to all , Don't stop believing.",3
"I have been prescribed Ambien for 3 years now, I used to take Xanax along with it so I never truly got to experience the hypnotic effects of Ambien on its own. Now I take it by itself and its a powerful medication. It can cause my appetite to get out of control, also  I had a major problem when I drank alcohol with it . My parents came home to find me, putting all my clothes in a suitcase I found somewhere in the house, a loaf of sliced bread spread all over the house and the yard, and me yelling at them for making my friends leave the game early, what the hell I was doing or talking about I still have no idea. So yes, don't drink and take Ambien in the course of a night because it leads to some bizarre activities. But all in all as a sleep aid it's great.",3
"On day 17 of 22 day Efudex fluorouracil 2% cream treatment on entire face, once a day, in the morning.  Redness started on day 2 and now I am very red, face feels tight and dry.  Some slight itchiness but not too uncomfortable. Bottom lip feels chapped. Face looks awful.  Use cortisone cream at night.  Fair skin, never tan, only sunburn.",3
Ok this is my third review. I can say nothing more that thanks god and new advance medicines. I am in the 3 month and I could not be happier.  Energy levels back to normal. I feel great. No side effects and my labs are great. My doctor forgot to tell me the numbers but from 300000 copies to undetectable I dont know my cd4 but my doctor was so pleased that he informed me you only have to come every 6 months so my next appointment February 2018 I feel human again and I keep forgetting I am HIV positive. Good attitude and awesome times ahead I am 40 very happy,3
"Last night was my first time to take Saphris. I woke up in a great mood, I'm not moody at all. It seems to be working but it's only been one day. I have tried every kind of medicine out there and nothing has worked so hopefully this one will. I had no hang over this morning I feel great. I haven't felt like this in years. Thank you to the makers of this medicine. It seems to work!",3
"I'm 18 and this is my first time being on birth control so when I read all the horrible reviews on Lutera I was really worried. But it's been about a week now and I can definitely say that I love it so far! Haven't had any side effects besides really bad nausea on the second day of the pill. But everything was fine after that. Haven't experienced any mood swings, decrease in sex drive. I've noticed that my appetite did increase just a little and my breasts have been more tender than usual.",3
"I must admit there were times I was constipated but take into consideration that constipation is NORMAL during pregnancy! This prenatal is one of the best in my opinion and at 27 weeks my healthy baby girl is kicking like there's no tomorrow! No problems thus far, just a healthy baby and pregnancy to show for it.",3
"After years of chronic pain and depression that responded to nothing I finally asked for a Vitamin D blood test. BINGO. Low normal is 40 - I was a 4. After 8 weeks of once a week doses of 20,000 units, and a daily dose of 2000 units, I am feeling better than I have in years! I live in AZ - low D can happen anywhere!",3
"I have had major depression or Treatment-resistant depression for 19 years. I have tried every medication.  I have tried every combination of medications and coming up in September I will have had done ECT for three years.  I started Viibryd 2 weeks ago and it has been amazing I feel like I am living, which is really strange to say! I feel like I have a future and I and so excited about it! It is to early to say if this medication will continue working for me but I really hope it does and it is an incredible feeling.",3
I can sleep through the night. No more getting up twice to just let it all out and clean up the mess. No more running to the bathroom every two hours because I'm leaking through. I love this.,3
"I had surgery removing of my small intestines. In Dec. 2013 was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, I have been taking Pentasa for about 3 months, since Jan. 2014. It has really helped me but I am losing handfuls of hair every day. I am also having dizzy spells. The hardest side effect to deal with is, every time I have a bowel movement, I have terrible itching inside my rectum. Otherwise I haven't noticed any other side effects yet.",3
"I started taking this drug for chronic daily headaches in 1999.  Turns out they were caused by stress  serious depression.  The Serzone was a miracle drug for me!  I saw the world so much more clearly and without the negative lens.  My headaches were gone (turns out it actually has a patent for preventing migraines!).  I was on it for 8 years until I moved to a new city and had trouble finding doctors to write for it.  So I was off it the last two years, and my doctor had me on awful Depakote instead.  I hated it!  I found a doctor this week to put me back on Nefazodone (Serzone).  I look forward to ramping up the dosage and feeling alive again!  It was a great drug for me without sexual side effects, which is important to many men.",3
They used Pitocin to induce all of my three labors.  It was effective right away.I dilated very quickly and experienced no side effects.  Very happy with it!,3
"I was diagnosed with stage 4 Leiomyosarcoma 7/16/2013. Tumors in my stomach, liver, and a few affected lymph nodes. Had surgery and removed 40% of my stomach on 8/30/13. Surgery was a success. I Underwent 4 1/2 months of chemo with minimal shrinkage to existing tumors but did stunt the growth of the tumors. At that point my tumors were considered inoperable. Started Votrient  2/14, just found out my tumors have shrunk enough on my liver to be operable. Liver Surgery scheduled 3/14. So happy, praying Votrient is our miracle. Good luck to others with my condition.",3
Do not take this if pill but  if you do take just one!,3
"I started to get anxiety and panic attacks when I was 24. I am now 30. I have tried multiple of medication for anxiety, bi-polar,depression etc. I was getting the racing thoughts but worst of all was the womp feeling you get it's hard to explain. I was on benzo as well and nothing helped me. Psychiatrist, group talk but your the only one who knows what you feel others do not understand it. I have always been a deep person and would think way to much. I got out of that stage on my own. Trust me it sucks i still get crazy but on Paxil it really helped me I only take Paxil nothing else. You name it I was on it schizophrenia meds as well. I understand when people say I can't get up I can't go out. Just try it all are different!",3
I was given this medicine to prevent a kidney infection while having a kidney stone pass. It worked and didn't have too many side effects. I would recommend it.,3
"Hi everyone! I started taking Saxenda 3 days and have already lost about 8 pounds. The first night I was very nauseous, but it hasn't been as bad. My appetite has become virtually non existent. I eat maybe a forth of what I used to eat, but I'm loving the results already. I've been on Metformin for almost 3 years and it's never done what this medication has. I'm on my way to my goal weight!",3
LOVE IT! No complaints.,3
"I have been on Qsymia for about 20 days and I have lost 12lbs. (I'm 2'11, 200lbs to start, now at 188lbs). I have played sports my entire life and recently quit, so the fact that I am still losing weight without as much exercise is amazing (Waitressing and housecleaning in college keep me active). I normally wouldn't take the time to write a review like this but I am so surprised by the results. My appetite is gone. I don't even realize that I haven't eaten since breakfast until I find myself wanting a nap around 4pm; then I'll remember I forgot to grab lunch! This NEVER happened before Qsymia. Long story short, I would recommend this 30%. Feel free to ask any questions!",3
Its ironic that Flagyl used to be given to alcoholics so they couldn't absorb alcohol in the liver causing terrible discomfort. Both meds Cipro and Flagyl work very well. Just take them separately and with some yogurt.,3
"I'm on day two, and just took third dose. I couldn't breath out of my nose and had the worst aches and pain imaginable. Woke up this morning still weak but I can breath out of both nostrils now and the aches and pains are finally dwindling a little. I have not experienced nausea related to the meds just the influenza has made me feel nauseated along with the many over the counter medications I have been taking. This drug works. If I woke up in pain like I felt last night I was going to the hospital. Thank goodness for this drug.",3
"I have suffered from anxiety and panic disorders for all of my adult life.  When I was diagnosed with Leukemia, my level of anxiety was at at all time high, because it also caused severe bone pain.  My pain-management Doctor had some samples of Niravam. The first week I tried it, my life was changed in a huge way.  It goes to work so quickly, if most effective and the half-life of this medicine seems short, so you aren't being over-medicated.  I've suggested it to others with the same disorder, but sadly, most doctors have never heard of it. I appreciate a safe, effective medication and just wish that more doctors were aware that it's more effective and no or very few side-effects, so they can benefit more patients.",3
"Great Medicine.I Coughed so much that the dr said I have bruised my ribs..very painful,this stuff is the best when you are having severe constant coughing it will give you relief and let you rest.wat better than the otc cough syrups.",3
"I used to be prescribed oxycontin, and became very addicted to pain medicines. I take Klonopin now after detoxing to keep me straight, and take the edge off. This pill keeps me satisfied as far as wanting to use an opiate (pain killers), because I have a very strong mental and physical addiction to opiates.",3
"After exhausting ALL options, this did job. I had  severe facial acne and now (3 months later on 30mg/day) I'm 30% clear. I saw a difference in the size of inflammation overnight. Experienced vertigo for the 1st month but you eventually reach equilibrium. My only concern is will it continue to stay clear. ",3
"My boyfriend and I had sex about 2 weeks ago and the condom broke. As teenagers with our whole life ahead of us, we absolutely freaked. We drove to the store and I took the pill within 20-30 minutes after the mishap. After reading these reviews (much like some of you panicking right now) it really helped me to feel better. A week later, on my usual day, I got my period! I experienced some nausea, headaches, tender breasts and weird moods but it didn't help that I was already suffering from a minor cold. I am so happy and thankful for Plan B- it literally saved my life!!! My best advice is to stay as calm as possible- stressing can make the symptoms and waiting worse. Let your guy know you need as much support as possible! Breathe ladies",3
I was in the hospital for intense vomiting and stomach pain. They gave me this drug and I felt better within 2 minutes.,3
"Tretinoin cream usp 0.022 works amazing!!! I've tried everything, and this is the only product that worked for me. After you make it through the first month of using this product for the first time, you will see a huge improvement! My face hasn't been this clear in awhile.",3
Was really ill started off with temp of 39.2 all body aches and pains. Took paracetamol and nothing happened. Went A  the next day whom did chest X-ray and took bloods said got slight infection but couldn't hear anything on my lungs so gave me iv paracetamol and fluids and sent home with amoxicillin 1 to be taken 3 times a day. After two days was still the same temp aches and pains etc. Went see my own GP whom heard crackling on lungs straight away and said suspects pneumonia and couldn't understand why the hospital didn't. He gave me clarithromycin 200mg twice a day. After taking the first one within one hour temp had gone and I was feeling a lot better. Had a bitter taste in mouth but didn't last long. These are the best antibiotics.,3
"This medicine is great, our patients no longer have to worry about if they miss a dose because it's taken once a day.",3
"I am immunodeficient and need antibiotics often. My doctors try to stay with the older generations of antibiotics for a lot of things, plus I'm allergic to a lot of them now; and Levaquin is prescribed for when I am having acute issues like sinus infection and it does work very well. I have never had any of the bad side effects from it other than feeling a bit out of sorts, maybe an upset stomach, but I'm also sick while taking it so I would feel off regardless. Unfortunately (because it's a fairly expensive antibiotic) it has over the last years worked quite well, even with me.",3
This drug is amazing. I lost 20lbs in 2 months.,3
"I took Plan B after a mishap. I was a little nervous, since I had never taken hormonal birth control. I had a slight bit of nausea, tiredness, and dizziness shortly after taking the pill, but no other side effects. I got my period about a week later, so it worked. It wasn't heavier or more painful than normal.",3
This is a good medicine.,3
"I have been taking this medication since I was 19 due to panic attacks, anxiety dissociation that came from my brother being diagnosed with a terrible mental health disorder. Since taking it, It's worked like a charm, I'm now 22 and am still on the medication. This SSRI is so mild and gentle &amp; I have 0 side effects. Please try this medication! My panic attacks are gone, my anxiety is minimal and my dissociation has disappeared. Please don't be ashamed to take something your brain may need. I'm now a Registered Nurse &amp; I'm so calm and happy and have my life back from anxiety and panic. Please give this a try! Oh and I'm currently on 20mg. Also, remember there is always hope. Praying for everyone who reads this.",3
"When I was in middle school I started experiencing hyperhydrosis of the underarms. I don't remember how I first came across Drysol, but it made such a huge difference in my life! I could wear ANY SHIRT I wanted! It definitely caused some itching/stinging of the underarm area if I applied it within 24 hours of shaving, so follow the directions. The day after the first use, my underarms were 30% sweat free. I used it for three consecutive nights, and after that I only needed to re-apply once a week, and eventually once a month, and so on. Today, I haven't used it in at least 8 years but I still don't have any underarm sweat. It basically deleted my axillary sweat glands. Hallelujah.",3
Wonderful med! Severe dry cough that got worse. Had a coughing fit that lasted for 6 hours and scared the life out of me. Kaiser prescribed. Took about an hour for coughing to calm down after taking. First night I coughed quite a bit but on the next 30 mg dose cough got better. Do not be discouraged if it does not work right away. Give it a few doses. I also added a humidifier to my bedroom and my coughs were more productive. That coupled with this medicine and I am happy to report after 4 days I am much better. This medicine is my savior. I was up 2 nights straight coughing before I took this.,3
I was prescribed this med during a stay in the Psychiatric ward at a hospital. I am 64 and was admitted because of suicidal thoughts. The drug side effects were very minor and the benefits and improvement to my wellbeing were significant and positive.,3
"I recently had an episode where my anxiety problem showed itself. I was hesitant to seek medical help or take any prescriptions. I am now very happy that I did. The medication settles me down and takes the edge off. I have not experienced any side effects. Actually, I don't even notice the meds doing anything. So I stopped for two days. That was a mistake. I quickly got really irritable and started experiencing anxiety by the end of the second day. So I started up again and it immediately went away. I hadn't realized that for most of my life, anxiety was getting in the way of thinking clearly. Now I'm a believer.",3
"I had a fatal accident 12 months ago a, broke both pelvis, multiple ribs, fractured ankle and many more fractures in my body. I use this medicine for the pain and it is 30% effective.",3
"I have had a sinus infection and ear infection for months on end. I was prescribed this and had been suffering severe constipation before. No more constipation, I have to take it easy because exertion makes the digestive issues worse but I understand the need to cleanse the system and for some that is diarrhea and vomit. Those that have allergic reactions I'm sorry but it isn't a reason to take it off the market, allergic reactions to meds should always be looked at. I'm hoping this will finally get rid of my infections can't smell and have loss of hearing. It sucks.",3
"As far as a drug that needs to be infused, it is about as easy as it can be to do.",3
"I have been on every diet known to man kind.  I have been told by my physician that if I don't do something, I am going to become diabetic.  I went to my doctor when I heard about this medication and was told he did not write diet pills.  He told me I needed to exercise more and eat better.  He said It would only give me temporary results.  However, after reading everything I could find on Qsymia, I found that it is indicated for long term use.  I figured I would have a better chance eating right if I weren't starving and battling cravings every time I tried.  I actually changed doctors because I felt my doctor was minimizing my issue.  He won't treat my obesity but he will let me become a diabetic! I have lost 17 lbs in 2 months.",3
Simply put Lamictal saved my life and NO side effects either.,3
Highly effective when taken for restless legs syndrome. I only need 1/2 of a 2.2mg pill. I take 1/4th of it one hour before I can tell I'll get the RLS symptoms then the other part at bedtime.,3
"I have had hives my entire life.  I finally saw an allergist and he did tests.  He took me off of all medicines and put me on Xyzal.  I took the Xyzal three times and I have not had a hive since.  Seriously.  I had my first hives at 4 months and had hives everyday for forty six years.  I do not know what Xyzal did but it fixed me.  I stopped taking Claritin and Benadryl and Zyrtec.  Took Xyzal for three days.  It made me VERY sleepy.  I can't even take a normal Benadryl dose without falling asleep, though.  I had to take liquid Benadryl, one teaspoon, if I wanted to stay awake.  I slept twelve hours with my first dose of Xyzal and about 8 hours with the two successive doses.  Then, I never had a hive again.",3
Just got marina inserted today. Was on bc for years tried pill patch. Hubby then got snip which failed but we are delighted with our little bundle of joy. Really did not know what to expect and was very nervous about insertion. I took ponston before hand and it did not hurt. Measurement went fine then when inserted felt something but very mild. Not like some reviews. So far so good but dont have it long enough to comment on side effects. Insertion not as bad as i expected. Will update in a few months time,3
"I just has Distal bicep surgery, extremely painful. The injury that lead up to surgery was painful. Doctor put me on Percocet 2/322 then my surgeon gave me Vicodin after the repair, well this did nothing. Went back to the Percocet, pain gone within 20-30 minutes. Now we are post-op 7 days pain pretty intense after cast and staples removed 1 tab every 8 works great for me.",3
"I have a son that has struggled with an attention problem in school since kindergarden. He is now 11 years old. We tried everything not to put him on medication. The homework struggle and impulsiveness became too much for us to handle, and we finally agreed to try something. His doctor told us about a new ADHD medication called Vyvanse. Believe this or not, it was like magic the first day. He was able to get all his work done in class, and went from a A,B,C student to all A's and one B in one quarter. We have the report cards to prove it. The side effects are minimal and for him the 30mg works great. I encourage anyone battling this problem to ask their childs doctor about Vyvanse. It has changed by sons life as well as ours.",3
before my body adjusted i had really bad mood swings. when my first cycle on the pill came around it was a little unsettling to say the least. bad cramping. inconsistent dark blood. menstruation is no longer a hassle though as its practically stopped completely. no mood swings. no change in appetite. less acne. you might not match this pill if you continue to yeild undesirable results.,3
This medication has been a life saver for me.  I usually bleed so bad that I can't go anywhere when I have my period. I flood the whole time!  My doctor prescribed this for my Disney Trip.  What a lifesaver!  My periods are much lighter and I have no side effects from this medication.  Love it!!,3
"I loved the product! I started June 1, 2014 to August 2014. IN 2 MONTHS I HAD LOST 30 LBS! I was doing Zumba 3 times a week and had a personal trainer to help tone my body with my new found ENERGY. The Personal Trainer was a waste because Adipex with Zumba was doing a tremendous job all on its own. I wasn't craving sweets thanks to Adipex. I cut out fast foods, carbs, and late night eating. Plus I drank anywhere from 1/2 to a gallon A DAY! However, the medicine still made me constipated. I started at 244 and got down to 209lbs. I stopped using it for about 2 months AND THE WEIGHT STAYED OFF, while not eating so healthy. ",3
"This medication didn't have an awful taste (I bought the liquid) and took care of my cough.  Unfortunately, I had severe diarrhea and ended up having to take an anti-diarrheal.  I probably won't use this medication again - the diarrhea was horrible! I would rather have a cough!",3
I'm not exercising at all. I'm just eating right. I have been on it 6 days now and I've lost 9 pounds. 1300 calories a day !!!,3
"I've been taking Oxycotin now for about two years. I've been through just about everything else you can think of due to the 2 ruptured discs I have. Pain blocker, nerve deadening, etc and even physical therapy but I've haven't found anything as useful as Oxycotin. It's been relatively side effect free for me and I can function pretty well day to day because of it.",3
"I used to get diarrhea with my panic attacks and Imodium A.D made it possible for me to still travel. It works almost instantly, it stops the got to go feeling instantaneously.",3
Works great to prevent migraines.,3
Was on depo for a year prior to switching to nexplanon in 2012. For the first 2 and half years there were no periods. The the last couple months of the 3 years however unpredictable periods started of varying durations of up to almost 3 weeks. Next insertion will probably be a few months before the 3 years to prevent the bleeding. New implant stopped the bleeding. No problems with weight gain or loosing weight on Nexplanon.,3
"Maxalt always seems to be my rescue drug for putting off full migraine. My Dr told me to take full 3mg tab (I would take 2mg as it worked) to alleviate rebound headaches. Also, she wanted to limit my intake of Maxalt to 2xday/2days wk/2days inbetween. I recently tried this with other drugs she prescribed for headaches inbetween.  I ended up in ER yesterday with the WORST migraine of my life. I'm looking for another Dr. and blame the new regimen for the problem. Has anyone else been told about limiting their Maxalt in this way? I get anywhere between 2-6 headaches a month, usually.",3
Was prescribed this medication for hormonal acne and started at 30mg daily. This did nothing for me so at my 3 month check up the dermatologist switched me to 120mg daily. This immediately made a huge difference in my skin and within 2 weeks I noticed a reduction in breakouts. I used to break out a lot during my monthly cycle and now I get maybe 1 pimple a month. I also started using a Clarisonic brush to cleanse my skin better.  You have to be patient with this medication as not everyone reacts the same to the same dosage. You and your doctor may have to try different doses before you get it right but once you do it is worth the wait!,3
"I think there is a reason the government has made Tramadol a category C drug.they want people in society to take it but everybody in society just wants to get high. Tramadol is the best DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, MILD PAIN MEDICINE EVER. This actually is better than everything without the high. If you actually wanna be a happy person without being high, this is it. 20 mg am- optional second until next day. Forget the critics. I would say this is like adderal, without the hunger side effects, lack of sleep, personality disorder, grumpyness, depression, etc etc etc. The best thing about it is the government is only selling it for $4 dollars. You don't even need health insurance.",3
It's a good medicine ..takes away my back pain and muscle spasms. The only downside is that it gives me blurred vision.,3
"Supposed to be 6 weeks to take effect. I felt instantly calmer, happen the NEXT day! Couldn't believe it. Started at 3mg moved to 20 MG in year of use. My problem now is  its been 7 years of working for me but 20mg doesn't have same effect of earlier years. I want to have  increase in MG use. How to I get doctor to do this?",3
I love it. No side effects. My periods have only been when I regulate them with pills. I have been on it for a year and 9 months and I'm not pregnant.,3
"I love Relpax.  When Excedrin Migraine doesn't work I take 1 20mg. Relpax and my migraine is gone in an hour without side effects.  So glad Relpax offers a $3.00 co-pay on their site, otherwise my insurance would charge me $60.00 for 9 pills.",3
"I absolutely loved this IUD. I was skeptical at first, being that I hopped on the internet and started reading reviews and pretty much all I saw were people saying how bad the pain was getting it inserted and that the pain was worse to get it removed. The pain getting it inserted was NOT as bad as I was expecting. It literally just was a cramp that was a smidge more painful than I was use to. Besides that, the insertion was not bad. I cramped/bled for about a month then after that my periods started to slowly lighten up and now 3 years later I basically have no period (which is awesome considering before my IUD I had the worst periods). I recommend Skyla to everyone.",3
"I used the brand name ROSULA yellow cream, which came in a tube, before they stopped making it.  When used it in the morning along with Duac at night, it helped my Rosacea and skin in general.  I went to another brand (only one active ingredient) when I could no longer get Rosula cream--it's a watery clear liquid; not as effective and drips everywhere.",3
"Ignore all the negative reviews because this drug might work for you. I've had depression for decades and have tried 18 different drugs over the years.  Only 3 meds have worked for me, and Fetzima is one of them. This drug saved my life.  The side effects slowly went away over a 6 week time period.  Yes, it is energizing at first and you may need to take an extra amount of benzo to calm you down, but the side effects eventually go away for some of us, although it seems like they never will for weeks.  Give it time to work!",3
"Very literally saved my life. My team of doctors, of course, made the rest of the difference.",3
"The first time I took Xanax was when I was having dental work and it was prescribed for the acute anxiety I feel with dentists. This past year my regular doctor suggested I might like to take it from time to time because of depression and anxiety. It helps tremendously. I usually break the .22 mg pill in half and just take half of one. I do not use it every day, but when I need it, it's wonderful and gets me to the next day.",3
Great.,3
"I smoked for forty years the last 3 ,2 1/2 packs a day, started chantix feb 1st 2012 , kept smoking will I took it, within a month I was down to two cigs a day and quit March 3rd I had my last cigarette, have not had one for 13 months , had no side effects at all. Was very easy, have a grandson that is 8 and he got me to quit. Would recommend to all tried everything patch, hypnosis, this is the only thing that worked feel good , and saving 6,000 dollars a year. Thank you chantix.",3
I was in great pain. This drug helped me immensely.,3
"I have been taking Contrave for three weeks and two days now, and as of this morning lost 17 pounds! I am also on a low to no carb diet, only what sugars are in fruits and veggies. I haven't walked as often as I need to, but plan to do that more. I had a little nausea at first, probably from the meds and from eating no carbs. I am so thrilled! I have 70 more pounds to go, but I am determined to do this. I am hypothyroid for last 12  years, so was skeptical that anything would help me. This has been great for me!!! Good luck to all! I received a coupon from my doctor and had to go online to register. This coupon saved me $230. I paid $70. The pharmacy originally said it was $300. There was NO WAY I could do that.",3
Good.,3
"I exercise every other day - intense 20 min. workout  w/dumbells including squats - and take 2mg Cialis within a 1 1/2 day timeframe of possibly having intercourse with my wife, which may be once or twice a week, and after 6 months of this routine I'm confident in my ability to make love again.  Without this combination I'm a lousy lover and only end up frustrating her because she thinks I'm uninterested or she's not pretty enough.",3
Good,3
Relaxed and calm,3
"Just took my 8th injection of .72 Trulicity today.  It has been amazing.  I always had trouble with my sugars and would get horrible welts from Levemir.  Doctor switched me from Levemir to Tresiba (62 units each morning) and the difference has been amazing.  I have GERD so all I can report is that it definitely has not been worse.  My sugars used to run around 230 to 323 most of the time.  Now they are from about 62 to 130.  If I'm under 80, I don't take any short-acting, which is Novolog for me.  I've lost about 7 pounds and my cravings are a thing of the past.  I am on SSDI and with prior-authorization from my endocrinologist, Medicare has authorized payment.  If it ever doesn't, Trulicity and I will part ways.",3
"I read these reviews and was very nervous preparing to take this.  I can't believe what all the fuss is about - I did not mind the taste at all and easily chugged everything I needed to chug with zero disgust or discomfort.  I didn't even have to chill it or drink it from a straw.  It was totally a piece of cake.  Took at 4:42pm.  Started working 30 minutes after taking.  I had been on pretty much a liquid diet for the 4 days leading up to this basic emptying of liquid from bowels - no cramps or gas or pain at all. Stayed near a bathroom to be safe, but never too urgent need to go -- went maybe 6 times in 2 hours.  Slept well.  Doing 2nd dosage now and do not foresee any problems whatsoever.  Again, I did not mind this in the least.",3
"My wart was on my forehead was big. When I started to use Duofilm it got sore and blood started to flow like tap water, I was very much afraid but continue to use it and now my wart has gone.",3
"Hello strangers. Im here to share my experience of taking emergency contraception, Ellaone. My period cycle has been very irregular last 3 monthes , assumed stresses. Therefore it was very hard to know when exactly my ovulation was. On November 19th, I had unprotected sex with my lover unexpectedly. He had condom initially but it dissappeared.He didnt notice that, so he literally came inside of my vagina. I was panic because of my irregular period cycle, I was not sure about everything. After 17hours of unprotected sexual relationship, I had Ellaone tablet. Regardless how much I worried, my period started today! It was actually starting early then I thought. So dont worry too much! It really works! Release your worries!",3
"I just had Nexplanon placed 6/4/13. The process was simple enough, the only pain I felt was the numbing process, then just tugging sensations as the Doctor placed the insert. Where my arm was cut has been slow to heal, but it is getting there. My biggest scare was that it would come out, it is still there so far! I haven't had any adverse side effects, only itching which I assume is my arm healing. I have been on pills since I was 12, so 16 years later I am excited to try a new method that I don't have to think about everyday. A friend recommended it to me and I would definitely recommend it anyone!",3
"I've been on this implant for about a year I absolutely hate it I weighed 120 after having my baby I was so small my doctor told me I would only gain about 2 pounds, I am now at 199 I've tried losing weight that doesn't work my acne is out of this world I barely get a period and when I do it last for like a day and a half! This implant is causing my body so many problems I have headaches all the time , My breast hurt , My back hurts , And it's so difficult trying to lose weight on this it makes me eat unusual I eat all day .. It keeps you baby free and I don't want to get it removed but it comes with so many side effects that your doctor doesn't really tell you about!",3
"I have been on this for two years now, and am very happy with it. I'm not as stressed and when I'm on my period, it helps with the pains, and the few times I'd stopped taking it, while I was on my period, my boyfriend mentioned that I'd turned into a little devil when I'd stopped taking it. ",3
"I was on levothyroxine for over 30 years.  This past year i felt like I had been hit by a bus when I woke up in the morning.  No energy to do anything, aches and pains in hips, legs and shoulders.  I went to my doc and asked her to change my medication to Nature Throid  after hearing about it from a friend who has Hoshimoto's.  Thankfully my doc agreed and after a few days, my energy was back, the aches and pain are gone.  I finally feel human again.  I had no side effects.  I wish this drug was available years ago.  My levo was expensive for a 90 day supply with insurance ($40), now it is only $17 for the same 90 day supply of Nature-Throid.",3
Post Cholysystectomy Syndrome: This medicine had been the best thing I have ever had. Regardless of the minor side effects I had it has saved me from constant diarrhea after having my gall bladder removed. I spent 8 miserable months having diarrhea multiple times a day. This has stopped it completely with little to no side effects. It does make me feel full if I take it right before I eat.,3
"I have tried Dulcolax, which will only  work if I take 3 or 4. MOM only work if I drink half the bottle. I took one Linzess and started drinking a lot of water, in about an hour was going and had no cramps or bloating feeling. Just don't pass gas because that's probably not what that is. Don't forget the WATER.",3
"Do not let the negative reviews scare you! I'm glad I didn't! Everybody is different you won't know how this birth control will work until you try it. If it doesn't work well with you remove it. I have nothing bad to say about Implanon. I have had it for 6 months, I still get a period though sometimes I skip a month. When I do get my period it is light panty liner light. No acne no weight gain, libido has not changed, no cravings, no mood swings. This has been the best birth control for me!",3
"After several wrist surgeries, I developed severe tendinitis on both sides of my wrist. For 20 years, I've been living in pain 24/7. These pain patches basically feel like happiness surrounding my wrist. I still have pain but it is at a much more tolerable level. I have my life back.  For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance. For my wrist, I am able to cut the patches into 2 halves and makes the prescription last longer. These saved my life.",3
"I have been taking this medicine for over 30 years (first as perscribed by doctor). Now it is very difficult to find and the only thing that works on my itchy eyes, itchy throat and sneezing at the same time. It also helps with any itchy skin due to pollen.",3
I have been on AndroGel for two months now and I can say this is the best I have felt in the last 2 years. I feel like I am 20 years old again. Not 23 anymore. My T count was at 31 I had no drive what so ever. Now 2 months on AndroGel and I am up to 780 count and still going up. Better body tone more muscle mass belly fat going away. I have lost over 12 lbs in 2 months. And I have more engery than I know  what to do with..And the wife has no complaints what so ever.,3
I took the pill Friday night and went to bed. I was rock hard most of the night. I have mild erectile dysfunction. With this medicine I go for hours. It gives you the confidence that you can think what you're going to do next and stop worrying about if its going to stay hard. My erections are firmer for some days after. No headaches or other side-effects. ,3
Fast and effective.,3
I have been taking this medicine for 2 weeks now and have gone from 330 pounds to 320. That's a huge deal for me because I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and typically cannot lose weight. It suppresses my appetite so much that I have to remind myself to eat. I have had no side effects at all and haven't increased my exercise. I am very happy with Belviq. Hopefully it continues to go well.,3
"I have been on various medications for years, some have been Lortab, non-narcotic pain medications, Ms-contin, Oxycontin and fentanyl patches.  I was on 120 micrograms of fentanyl/48 hours before switching to Opana ER.  Initially I was taking 20mg of Opana 2x/day and it was not sufficient for my pain, but I couldn't handle the side-effects of the fentanyl patches (narcolepsy) so I worked with my doctor to increase my dosage and frequency so that I now take 30mg 2x/day and 20mg 1x/day.  It is expensive but I am finally able to live a near-normal life.  I play with my kids, I don't miss work, and I even keep the house up (with great help from my better half).  Opana ER has been great for pain relief with almost no side-effects!",3
I've been on Effexor xr for 2 weeks and it's great. I had been on Zoloft before and it pooped out on me so my doc switched me to Effexor xr and after 2 days I started feeling good again. I take 37.2 mg per day. I come back to write here because I wanna give back to this forum and give hope for anybody that suffer from this like me. keep to try the med that suit for you. best wish!,3
Been constipated for 2 days now. Bought the cherry flavor and took the indicated at night by the morning have never felt so good felt the bloating go away also. Poop my guts out ,3
The BEST medication for controlling my cough due to recurring and sometimes chronic bronchitis. I have never had any side effects whatsoever. I just stop coughing.,3
"I didn't experience any side effects whatsoever. I've been on Aviane For 3 months now, the only thing I noticed is my breasts and back got a little bigger. My face got so much smoother after about 3 weeks. I Love Aviane.",3
Well I started at a 30mg dose and within 3 days it kicked in. I felt great...laughing again. ..cleaning the house again...friendly and chatty. No anxiety either. It was a lifesaver for me.,3
"Started with an SSRI for anxiety and it just didn't work. Finally got prescribed this benzo Klonopin and it's perfect! I take 0.2mg, but when I take it, my anxiety goes away. I feel like I can do anything, with a clear mind of course. I don't have to hide away anymore. I thought this drug might make me &quot;stoned&quot; or something, but really all I experience is, after about 12 min, a general clear-minded sense of well-being and it works for a while. Good stuff.",3
I have been using this for about 6 days now and already notice a huge difference. The first few days I was very tired but it was well worth it to get rid of the skin condition that came from nowhere. I am 32 and my skin had never done this before. I am so happy that this is working and thank God that it was not an expensive medication either considering I am a widow and single mom. I would tell anyone with this problem to try this first and skip anything else. It is just an infection. Best of luck to you all.,3
"I finally made the decision to seek professional help for my depression/major anxiety.  After trying to self heal for 2 years, I realized that I couldn't beat the anxiety on my own.  I cried the night before my Dr. appointment, due to feelings of failure because I couldn't cure it myself, and I also cried through my entire appointment.  I was severely depressed from having to live with anxiety and fear.  A horrible and embarrassing thing to live with.  My Dr. perscribed me Celexa and I honestly didn't think it would work.  I almost gave up taking Celexa because it took 3 weeks to kick in and I am impatient.  After taking Celexa, I find that I am much calmer. I don't worry about things and I am happier and less fearful.  Only side effect is grinding of teeth.",3
"Started on 11/14/14, at 227.8 lbs at 2'6&quot; tall - 8 months later I have lost 21 lbs, am now 176.8 lbs. I have gone from a size 16 to a 3-12 depending on the brand. Side effects are dry mouth (solved by drinking a ton of water) and tingling in feet, which I notice more as it becomes time to take the next dose in the morning. Qsymia definitely curbed the snacking, the over eating, etc. Changed the way I eat, increased fresh vegetables, cut carbs (no bread, limited starch, etc.) and stopped eating processed foods. Began to cook dinner more, to control the butter, oil, cooking method rather than relying on the quick fix of takeout. This has made a HUGE difference. Increased activity as well. I can see my curves again. 20 lbs. to go!",3
